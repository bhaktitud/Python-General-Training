<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:0px;">His long and productive career earned the Abel Prize</p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:0px;">for his &quot;vast and lasting impact on the theory of numbers</p>

<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:0px;">(1926-) France&lt;/a&gt;</p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:0px;">&lt;blockquote&gt;Serre did important work with spectral sequences</p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:0px;">and algebraic methods,</p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:0px;">revolutionizing the study of algebraic topology and algebraic geometry,</p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:0px;">especially homotopy groups and sheaves.</p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:0px;">Hermann Weyl praised Serre's work strongly, saying it</p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:0px;">gave an important new algebraic basis to analysis.</p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:0px;">He collaborated with Grothendieck and Pierre Deligne, helped resolve the</p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:0px;">Weil conjectures, and contributed indirectly to</p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:0px;">the recent proof of Fermat's Last Theorem.</p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:0px;">His wide range of research areas also includes</p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:0px;">number theory, bundles, fibrations, p-adic modular forms,</p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:0px;">Galois representation theory, and more.</p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:0px;">Serre has been much honored: he is the youngest ever to win</p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:0px;">a Fields Medal; 49 years after his Fields Medal he became</p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:0px;">the first recipient of the Abel Prize.</p>

<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:0px;">(1928-2014) Germany, France&lt;/a&gt;</p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:0px;">&lt;blockquote&gt;</p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:0px;">Grothendieck has done brilliant work in several areas of mathematics</p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:0px;">including number theory, geometry, topology,</p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:0px;">and functional analysis,</p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:0px;">but especially in the fields of algebraic geometry</p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:0px;">and category theory, both of which he revolutionized.</p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:0px;">He is especially noted for his invention of the Theory of Schemes,</p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:0px;">and other methods to unify different branches of mathematics.</p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:0px;">He applied algebraic geometry to number theory;</p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:0px;">applied methods of topology to set theory; etc.</p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:0px;">Grothendieck is considered a master of abstraction, rigor and presentation.</p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:0px;">He has produced many important and deep results in homological algebra,</p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:0px;">most notably his etale cohomology.</p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:0px;">With these new methods, Grothendieck and his outstanding student Pierre Deligne</p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:0px;">were able to prove the Weil Conjectures.</p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:0px;">Grothendieck also developed the theory of sheafs, the theory of motives,</p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:0px;">generalized the Riemann-Roch Theorem to revolutionize K-theory,</p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:0px;">developed Grothendieck categories, crystalline cohomology,</p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:0px;">infinity-stacks and more.</p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:0px;">The guiding principle behind much of Grothendieck's work has been</p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:0px;">Topos Theory, which he invented to harness the methods of topology.</p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:0px;">These methods and results have redirected several diverse branches</p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:0px;">of modern mathematics including number theory, algebraic topology,</p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:0px;">and representation theory.</p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:0px;">Among Grothendieck's famous results was his Fundamental Theorem</p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:0px;">in the Metric Theory of Tensor Products, which was inspired by</p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:0px;">Littlewood's proof of the &lt;i&gt;4/3 Inequality&lt;/i&gt;.</p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:0px;">&lt;p&gt;Grothendieck's radical religious and political philosophies</p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:0px;">led him to retire from public life while still in his prime, but</p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:0px;">he is widely regarded as the greatest mathematician of the 20th</p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:0px;">century, and indeed one of the greatest geniuses ever. </p>

<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:0px;">(1928-2015) U.S.A&lt;/a&gt;</p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:0px;">&lt;blockquote&gt;The &lt;i&gt;Riemann Embedding Problems&lt;/i&gt; were important puzzles</p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:0px;">of geometry that baffled many of the greatest minds for a century.</p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:0px;">Hilbert showed that Lobachevsky's hyperbolic plane</p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:0px;">could not be embedded into Euclidean 3-space, but what about into</p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:0px;">Euclidean 4-space?</p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:0px;">Cartan and Chern were among the great mathematicians who solved</p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:0px;">various special cases, but using &quot;methods entirely without precedent&quot;</p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:0px;">John Nash demonstrated a general solution.</p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:0px;">This was a true highlight of 20th-century mathematics.</p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:0px;">&lt;p&gt;Nash was a lonely, tormented schizophrenic whose life</p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:0px;">was portrayed in the film &lt;i&gt;Beautiful Mind&lt;/i&gt;. </p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:0px;">He achieved early fame with his work in game theory; this eventually</p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:0px;">led to the Nobel Prize in Economics.</p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:0px;">Earlier studies in game theory focused on the simplest</p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:0px;">cases (two-person zero-sum, or cooperative), but Nash</p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:0px;">demonstrated &quot;Nash equilibria&quot; for n-person or non-zero-sum</p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:0px;">non-cooperative games.</p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:0px;">Nash also excelled at several other fields of mathematics,</p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:0px;">especially topology, algebraic geometry, partial differential equations,</p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:0px;">elliptic functions, and the theory of manifolds (including</p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:0px;">singularity theory, the concept of real algebraic manifolds</p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:0px;">and isotropic embeddings).</p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:0px;">He proved theorems of great importance which had defeated all</p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:0px;">earlier attempts.</p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:0px;">His most famous theorems were the Nash Embedding Theorems,</p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:0px;">e.g. that any Riemannian manifold of dimension &lt;i&gt;k&lt;/i&gt; can be embedded</p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:0px;">isometrically into some n-dimensional Euclidean space.</p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:0px;">Other important work was in partial differential equations where</p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:0px;">he proved that strong regularity constraints apply to</p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:0px;">solutions of the equations of heat and fluid flow.</p>

<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:0px;">harmonic analysis, and dynamical systems; he proved many difficult</p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:0px;">and important theorems;</p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:0px;">among these are a theorem about</p>

<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:0px;">Carleson great fame.</p>

<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:0px;">In 1966, four years after proving Kakutani's Conjecture,</p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:0px;">he proved the 53-year old Luzin's Conjecture,</p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:0px;">a strong statement about Fourier convergence.</p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:0px;">This was startling because of a 38-year old conjecture suggested</p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:0px;">by Kolmogorov &lt;i&gt;that Luzin's Conjecture was false&lt;/i&gt;.</p>

<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:0px;">&lt;blockquote&gt;Atiyah's career has had extraordinary breadth and depth.</p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:0px;">He advanced the theory of vector bundles;</p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:0px;">this developed into topological K-theory</p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:0px;">and the Atiyah-Singer Index Theorem.</p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:0px;">This Index Theorem is considered one of the most</p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:0px;">far-reaching theorems ever, subsuming famous old results (Descartes'</p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:0px;">total angular defect, Euler's topological characteristic),</p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:0px;">important 19th-century theorems (Gauss-Bonnet, Riemann-Roch),</p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:0px;">and incorporating important work by Weil and especially Shiing-Shen Chern.</p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:0px;">It is a key to the study of high-dimension</p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:0px;">spaces, differential geometry, and equation solving.</p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:0px;">Several other key results are named after Atiyah,</p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:0px;">e.g. the Atiyah-Bott Fixed-Point Theorem,</p>

<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:0px;">and the Atiyah-Hirzebruch spectral sequence.</p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:0px;">Atiyah's work developed important connections not only between</p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:0px;">topology and analysis, but with modern physics; Atiyah himself has</p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:0px;">been a key figure in the development of string theory;</p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:0px;">and is a proponent of the recent idea that octonions may</p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:0px;">underlie particle physics.</p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:0px;">This work, and Atiyah-inspired work in gauge theory, restored</p>

<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:0px;">Atiyah is known as a vivacious genius in person, inspiring many,</p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:0px;">e.g. Edward Witten.</p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:0px;">Along with Serre, Atiyah is often considered to</p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:0px;">be one of the very greatest living mathematicians born</p>

<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:0px;">&lt;blockquote&gt;Milnor founded the field of differential topology</p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:0px;">and has made other major advances in topology,</p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:0px;">algebraic geometry and dynamical systems.</p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:0px;">He discovered Milnor maps (related to fiber bundles);</p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:0px;">important theorems in knot theory;</p>

<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:0px;">He followed up by proving (with Walter Feit) that all nonabelian</p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:0px;">finite simple groups are of even order.  This result, proved in</p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:0px;">a 250-page paper, stunned the world of mathematics; it led to</p>

<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:0px;">proof allowed Langlands to prove a famous conjecture of Artin, and Wiles</p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:0px;">to prove Fermat's Last Theorem.</p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:0px;">Langlands and others have applied these methods to prove several</p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:0px;">other old conjectures, and to formulate new more powerful conjectures.</p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:0px;">He has also worked with Eisenstein series, L-functions, Lie groups,</p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:0px;">percolation theory, etc.</p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:0px;">He mentored several important mathematicians (including Thomas Hales,</p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:0px;">mentioned briefly in Pappus' mini-bio).</p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:0px;">&lt;p&gt;Langlands once wrote &quot;Certainly the best times were when I was alone with</p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:0px;">mathematics, free of ambition and pretense, and indifferent to the world.&quot;</p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:0px;">He was appointed Hermann Weyl Professor at the Institute for Advanced Study</p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:0px;">and now sits in the office once occupied by Albert Einstein.</p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:0px;">This seems appropriate since, as the man &quot;who reinvented mathematics,&quot;</p>

<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:0px;">In addition to dynamical systems theory, Arnold made contributions</p>

<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:0px;">&lt;blockquote&gt;Conway has done pioneering work in a very broad range</p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:0px;">of mathematics including knot theory, number theory, group theory,</p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:0px;">lattice theory, combinatorial game theory, geometry, quaternions,</p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:0px;">tilings, and cellular automaton theory.</p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:0px;">He started his career by proving a case of Waring's Problem,</p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:0px;">but achieved fame when he discovered the largest then-known</p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:0px;">sporadic group (the symmetry group of the Leech lattice);</p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:0px;">this sporadic group is now known to be second in size</p>

<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:0px;">construction of the regular heptagon (a feat also achieved</p>

<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:0px;">conjectures in recreational mathematics.</p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:0px;">He found the simplest proof for Morley's Trisector Theorem (sometimes</p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:0px;">called the best result in simple plane geometry since ancient Greece).</p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:0px;">He proved an unusual theorem about quantum physics:</p>

<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:0px;">His most important theoretical invention, however,</p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:0px;">may be his &lt;i&gt;surreal numbers&lt;/i&gt; incorporating infinitesimals;</p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:0px;">he invented them to solve combinatorial games like Go,</p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:0px;">but they have pure mathematical significance as the</p>

<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:0px;">they revolutionized the study of symplectic manifolds and are important</p>

<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:0px;">His work has led to new methods in diverse fields like group theory,</p>

<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:0px;">it was his work which eventually led Perelman</p>

<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:0px;">physics, but his broad knowledge of physics, especially quantum field</p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:0px;">theory, string theory, supersymmetry, and quantum gravity,</p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:0px;">has led him to novel connections and insights in abstract geometry and topology,</p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:0px;">as well as physics.</p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:0px;">His skill with string theory led him to a novel theory of invariants and</p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:0px;">allowed him to improve results in knot theory;</p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:0px;">his skill with supersymmetry led him to new results in differential geometry. </p>

<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:0px;">found new insights there.</p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:0px;">He has proven several important new theorems of mathematics and</p>

<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:0px;">Among his earliest important discoveries were results about the</p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:0px;">multi-dimensional Kakeya needle problem, which led to advances in</p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:0px;">Fourier analysis and fractals.</p>

<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:0px;">and a startlingly natural point of view.&quot;</p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:0px;">&lt;p&gt;Paul Erd&amp;ouml;s mentored Tao when he was a ten-year old prodigy,</p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:0px;">and the two are frequently compared.  They are both prolific</p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:0px;">problem solvers across many fields, though have founded no new fields.</p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:0px;">As with Erd&amp;ouml;s, much of Tao's work has been done in collaboration:</p>

<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:0px;">with Ben Green he proved the Dirac-Motzkin conjecture and</p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:0px;">solved the &quot;orchard-planting problem.&quot;</p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:0px;">Especially famous is the Green-Tao Theorem that there are arbitrarily long</p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:0px;">arithmetic series among the prime numbers (or indeed among any sufficiently</p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:0px;">dense subset of the primes).  This confirmed an old</p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:0px;">conjecture by Lagrange, and was especially remarkable because the</p>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:0px;">proof fused methods from number theory, ergodic theory, harmonic analysis,</p>

The markings include six prime numbers (5, 7, 11, 13, 17, 19)\nin order, though this is probably coincidence.\n\n&lt;p&gt;The advanced artifacts of Egypt\'s Old Kingdom\nand the Indus-Harrapa civilization\nimply strong mathematical skill, but the first\nwritten evidence of advanced arithmetic dates from Sumeria,\nwhere 4500-year old clay tablets show multiplication and\ndivision problems; the first abacus may be about this old.\nBy 3600 years ago, Mesopotamian tablets show\ntables of squares, cubes, reciprocals, and even logarithms\nand trig functions,\nusing a primitive place-value system (in base 60, not 10).\nBabylonians were familiar with the Pythagorean Theorem,\nsolutions to quadratic equations,\neven cubic equations (though they didn\'t have a general solution for these),\nand eventually even developed methods to estimate\nterms for compound interest.\nThe Greeks borrowed from Babylonian mathematics, which was the most\nadvanced of any before the Greeks; but there is no\nancient Babylonian mathematician whose name is known.\n\n&lt;p&gt;Also at least 3600 years ago, the Egyptian scribe Ahmes\nproduced a famous manuscript\n(now called the &lt;i&gt;Rhind Papyrus&lt;/i&gt;),\nitself a copy of a late Middle Kingdom text.\nIt showed simple algebra methods and\nincluded a table giving optimal\nexpressions using Egyptian fractions.\n(Today, Egyptian fractions lead to challenging number theory\nproblems with no practical applications, but they may have\nhad practical value for the Egyptians.\nTo divide 17 grain bushels among 21 workers, the\nequation 17/21 = 1/2 + 1/6 + 1/7 has practical value,\nespecially when compared with\nthe &quot;greedy&quot; decomposition\n17/21 = 1/2 + 1/4 + 1/17 + 1/1428.)\n\n&lt;p&gt;The Pyramids demonstrate that Egyptians\nwere adept at geometry, though little written evidence survives.\nBabylon was much more advanced than Egypt at arithmetic and algebra;\nthis was probably due, at least in part, to their place-value system.\nBut although their base-60 system survives (e.g. in the division\nof hours and degrees into minutes and seconds) the Babylonian\nnotation, which used the equivalent of IIIIII XXXXXIIIIIII XXXXIII\nto denote 417+43/60, was unwieldy compared to the\n&quot;ten digits of the Hindus.&quot;\n(In 2016 historians were surprised to decode ancient Babylonian\ntexts and find very sophisticated astronomical calculations\nof Jupiter\'s orbit.)\n\n&lt;p&gt;The Egyptians used the approximation\n&lt;b&gt;&amp;pi; &amp;asymp; (4/3)&lt;sup&gt;4&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/b&gt;\n(derived from the idea that a\ncircle of diameter 9 has about the same area as a square of side 8).\nAlthough the ancient Hindu mathematician Apastambha had achieved\na good approximation for &lt;b&gt;&amp;radic;2&lt;/b&gt;, and the ancient Babylonians\nan ever better &lt;b&gt;&amp;radic;2&lt;/b&gt;, neither of these ancient\ncultures achieved a &lt;i&gt;&amp;pi;&lt;/i&gt;

have been written about 1000 BC.\n&lt;/blockquote&gt;\n\n&lt;center&gt;&lt;font size=+0&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#top&quot;&gt;Top&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/center&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;a NAME=&quot;Thales&quot;

of ancient Greece,\nand has been called the &quot;Father of Science,&quot;\nthe &quot;Founder of Abstract Geometry,&quot;\nand the &quot;First Philosopher.&quot;\nThales is believed to have studied mathematics\nunder Egyptians, who in turn were aware of much older\nmathematics from Mesopotamia.\nThales may have invented the notion of compass-and-straightedge\nconstruction.\nSeveral fundamental theorems about triangles\nare attributed to Thales, including the law of similar triangles\n(which Thales used famously to calculate the height of the Great Pyramid)\nand &quot;Thales\' Theorem&quot; itself: the fact that any angle inscribed in\na semicircle is a right angle.\n(The other &quot;theorems&quot; were probably more like well-known axioms,\nbut Thales proved Thales\' Theorem using two of\nhis other theorems; it is said that Thales then sacrificed\nan ox to celebrate what might have been the first\nmathematical proof in Greece.)\nThales noted that, given a line segment\nof length &lt;i&gt;x&lt;/i&gt;, a segment of length &lt;i&gt;x/k&lt;/i&gt; can be constructed\nby first constructing a segment of length &lt;i&gt;kx&lt;/i&gt;.\n\n&lt;p&gt;Thales was also an astronomer; he invented the 365-day calendar,\nintroduced the use of Ursa Minor for finding North,\ninvented the gnomonic map projection (the first of many\nmethods known today to map (part of) the surface of a sphere\nto a plane,\nand is the first person believed to have correctly predicted a solar eclipse.\nHis theories of physics would seem quaint today, but he\nseems to have been the first to describe magnetism and static electricity.\nAristotle said, &quot;To Thales the primary question was\nnot what do we know, but how do we know it.&quot;\nThales was also a politician, ethicist, and military strategist.\nIt is said he once leased all available olive presses\nafter predicting a good olive season; he did this not\nfor the wealth itself, but as a demonstration of the use\nof intelligence in business.\nThales\' writings have not survived and are known only second-hand.\nSince his famous theorems of geometry were probably already known\nin ancient Babylon, his importance derives from imparting the\nnotions of mathematical proof and the scientific method\nto ancient Greeks.\n\n&lt;p&gt;Thales\' student and successor was Anaximander, who is often called\nthe &quot;First Scientist&quot; instead of Thales: his theories were more\nfirmly based on experimentation and logic, while Thales still\nrelied on some animistic interpretations.\nAnaximander is famous for astronomy, cartography and sundials,\nand also enunciated a theory of evolution, that land species\nsomehow developed from primordial fish!\nAnaximander\'s most famous student, in turn, was Pythagoras.\n(The methods of Thales and Pythagoras led to the schools of\nPlato and Euclid, an intellectual blossoming unequaled until\nEurope\'s Renaissance.\nFor this reason Thales may belong on this list for his\nhistorical importance despite his relative lack of\nmathematical achievements.)\n&lt;/blockquote&gt;\n\n&lt;center&gt;&lt;font size=+0&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#top&quot;&gt;Top&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/center&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;a NAME=&quot;Apast&quot;

577/408&lt;/b&gt;, a result probably derived with\na geometric argument.\n\n&lt;p&gt;Apastambha built on the work of earlier Vedic scholars,\nespecially Baudhayana, as well\nas Harappan and (probably) Mesopotamian mathematicians.\nHis notation and proofs were primitive, and there is little\ncertainty about his life.\nHowever similar comments apply to Thales of Miletus, so it seems\nfair to mention Apastambha (who was perhaps the\nmost creative Vedic mathematician before Panini)\nalong with Thales as one of the\nearliest mathematicians whose name is known.\n&lt;/blockquote&gt;\n\n&lt;center&gt;&lt;font size=+0&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#top&quot;&gt;Top&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/center&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;a NAME=&quot;Pythagoras&quot;

he became\nthe most influential of early Greek mathematicians.\nHe is credited with being first to use axioms\nand deductive proofs, so his influence on Plato and Euclid may be enormous;\nhe is generally credited with much of\nBooks I and II of Euclid\'s &lt;i&gt;Elements&lt;/i&gt;.\nHe and his students (the &quot;Pythagoreans&quot;) were ascetic mystics\nfor whom mathematics was partly a spiritual tool.\n(Some occultists treat Pythagoras as a wizard and founding mystic\nphilosopher.)\nPythagoras was very interested in astronomy and seems to have been the\nfirst man to realize that the Earth was a globe similar to the other planets.\nHe and his followers began to study the question of planetary motions,\nwhich would not be resolved for more than two millennia.\nHe believed thinking was located in the brain rather than heart.\nThe words &lt;i&gt;philosophy&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;mathematics&lt;/i&gt; are said to have\nbeen coined by Pythagoras.\nHe is supposed to have invented the &lt;i&gt;Pythagorean Cup&lt;/i&gt;, a clever\nwine goblet which punishes a drinker who greedily fills his cup to the top\nby then using siphon pressure to drain the cup.\n\n&lt;p&gt;Despite Pythagoras\' historical importance I may have ranked him too high:\nmany results of the Pythagoreans were\ndue to his students; none of their writings survive; and what\nis known is reported second-hand, and possibly\nexaggerated, by Plato and others.\nSome ideas attributed to him were probably first enunciated by successors\nlike Parmenides of Elea (ca 515-440 BC).\nArchaeologists now believe that he was not first to invent the diatonic\nscale: &lt;a\nhref=&quot;http://www.openculture.com/2014/07/the-oldest-song-in-the-world.html&quot;&gt;\nHere is a diatonic-scale song from Ugarit&lt;/a&gt;\nwhich predates Pythagoras by eight centuries.\n&lt;p&gt;Pythagoras\' students included Hippasus of Metapontum,\nthe famous anatomist and physician Alcmaeon, Milo of Croton,\nand Croton\'s daughter Theano (who may have been Pythagoras\'s wife).\nThe term &lt;i&gt;Pythagorean&lt;/i&gt; was also adopted by many disciples who lived later;\nthese disciples include Philolaus of Croton,\nthe natural philosopher Empedocles, and several other famous Greeks.\nPythagoras\' successor was apparently Theano herself:\nthe Pythagoreans were one of the few ancient schools\nto practice gender equality.\n\n&lt;p&gt;Pythagoras discovered that harmonious intervals in music are based on\nsimple rational numbers.\nThis led to a fascination with integers\nand mystic numerology;\nhe is sometimes called the &quot;Father of Numbers&quot;\nand once said &quot;Number rules the universe.&quot;\n(About the mathematical basis of music, Leibniz later wrote,\n&quot;Music is the pleasure the human soul experiences from counting\nwithout being aware that it is counting.&quot;\nOther mathematicians who investigated the arithmetic\nof music included Huygens, Euler and Simon Stevin.)\nGiven any numbers &lt;b&gt;a&lt;/b&gt; and &lt;b&gt;b&lt;/b&gt; the Pythagoreans were aware\nof the three distinct means:\n&lt;b&gt;(a+b)/2&lt;/b&gt; (arithmetic mean),\n&lt;b&gt;&amp;radic;(ab)&lt;/b&gt; (geometric mean), and\n&lt;b&gt;2ab/(a+b)&lt;/b&gt; (harmonic mean).\n\n&lt;p&gt;The Pythagorean Theorem was known long before Pythagoras,\nbut he was often credited (before discovery of an ancient Chinese text)\nwith the first &lt;i&gt;proof&lt;/i&gt;.\nHe may have discovered the simple parametric form\nof primitive Pythagorean triplets &lt;b&gt;(xx-yy, 2xy, xx+yy)&lt;/b&gt;,\nalthough the first explicit mention of this may be in Euclid\'s &lt;i&gt;Elements&lt;/i&gt;.\nOther discoveries of the Pythagorean school include the\nconstruction of the regular pentagon,\nconcepts of perfect and amicable numbers,\npolygonal numbers,\ngolden ratio (attributed to Theano),\nthree of the five regular solids (attributed to Pythagoras himself),\nand irrational numbers (attributed to Hippasus).\nIt is said that the discovery\nof irrational numbers upset the Pythagoreans so much\nthey tossed Hippasus into the ocean!\n(Another version has Hippasus banished for revealing\nthe secret for constructing the sphere which circumscribes\na dodecahedron.)\n\n&lt;p&gt;In addition to Parmenides, the famous successors of Thales and Pythagoras\ninclude Zeno of Elea (see below),\nHippocrates of Chios (see below),\nPlato of Athens (ca 428-348 BC),\nTheaetetus (see below), and Archytas (see below).\nThese early Greeks ushered in a Golden Age of Mathematics\nand Philosophy\nunequaled in Europe until the Renaissance.\nThe emphasis was on pure, rather than practical, mathematics.\nPlato (who ranks #40 on Michael Hart\'s famous list of\nthe Most Influential Persons in History)\ndecreed that his scholars should do\ngeometric construction solely with compass and straight-edge\nrather than with &quot;carpenter\'s tools&quot; like\nrulers and protractors.\n&lt;/blockquote&gt;\n\n&lt;center&gt;&lt;font size=+0&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#top&quot;&gt;Top&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/center&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;a NAME=&quot;Panini&quot;

since the rigor\nof his grammar is comparable to Euclid\'s geometry.\n\n&lt;p&gt;Although his great texts have been preserved, little else\nis known about Panini.  Some scholars would place his dates a century\nlater than shown here; he may or may not have been the same person\nas the famous poet Panini.\nIn any case, he was the very last Vedic Sanskrit scholar by\ndefinition: his text formed the transition to the\nClassic Sanskrit period.\nPanini has been called &quot;one of the most innovative\npeople in the whole development of knowledge;&quot;\nhis grammar &quot;one of the greatest monuments of human intelligence.&quot;\n&lt;/blockquote&gt;\n\n&lt;center&gt;&lt;font size=+0&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#top&quot;&gt;Top&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/center&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;a NAME=&quot;Zeno&quot; title=&quot;(not ranked)&quot;&gt;&lt;font size=+0&gt;&lt;u&gt;&lt;font color=&quot;#a00000&quot;&gt;\n&lt;b&gt;Zeno&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/font&gt; of Elea&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/font&gt;\n(ca 495-435 BC) Greek domain&lt;/a&gt;\n&lt;blockquote&gt;Zeno, a student of Parmenides, had great fame in\nancient Greece.\nThis fame, which continues to the present-day, is largely due to\nhis paradoxes of infinitesimals, e.g. his argument\nthat Achilles can never catch the tortoise (whenever Achilles arrives\nat the tortoise\'s last position, the tortoise has moved on).\nAlthough some regard these paradoxes as simple fallacies,\nthey have been contemplated for many centuries.\nIt is due to these paradoxes that\nthe use of infinitesimals, which provides the basis for mathematical analysis,\nhas been regarded as a non-rigorous heuristic and\nis finally viewed as sound only after the work of the great\n19th-century rigorists, Dedekind and Weierstrass.\nZeno\'s Arrow Paradox (at any single instant an arrow is at a fixed\nposition, so where does its motion come from?) has lent its name to\nthe Quantum Zeno Effect, a paradox of quantum physics.\n&lt;p&gt;Eubulides of Miletus\nwas another ancient Greek famous for paradoxes,\ne.g. &quot;This statement is a lie&quot; -- the sort of inconsistency\nlater used in proofs by G&amp;ouml;del and Turing.\n&lt;/blockquote&gt;\n\n&lt;center&gt;&lt;font size=+0&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#top&quot;&gt;Top&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/center&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;a NAME=&quot;Hippoc&quot; title=&quot;Ranked at &amp;nbsp; #117&quot;&gt;&lt;font size=+1&gt;&lt;u&gt;&lt;font color=&quot;#a00000&quot;&gt;\n&lt;b&gt;Hippocrates&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/font&gt; of Chios&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/font&gt;\n(ca 470-410 BC) Greek domain&lt;/a&gt;\n&lt;blockquote&gt;Hippocrates (no known relation to Hippocrates of Cos,\nthe famous physician)\nwrote his own &lt;i&gt;Elements&lt;/i&gt; more than\na century before Euclid.

Hippocrates is said to\nhave invented the &lt;i&gt;reductio ad absurdem&lt;/i&gt; proof method.\nHippocrates is most famous for his work on the three ancient\ngeometric quandaries: his work on cube-doubling\n(the &lt;i&gt;Delian Problem&lt;/i&gt;) laid the groundwork\nfor successful efforts by Archytas and others;\nand some claim Hippocrates was first to trisect the general angle.\nHis circle quadrature was of course ultimately unsuccessful but\nhe did prove ingenious theorems about &quot;lunes&quot; (crescent-shaped\ncircle fragments).\nFor example, the area of any right triangle is equal to the\nsum of the areas of the two lunes formed when semi-circles\nare drawn on each of the three edges of the triangle.\nHippocrates also did work in algebra and rudimentary analysis.\n&lt;p&gt;(Doubling the cube and angle trisection are often called\n&quot;impossible,&quot; but they are impossible only when restricted to\ncollapsing compass and unmarkable straightedge.\nThere are ingenious solutions available with other tools.\nConstruction of the regular heptagon is another such task,\nwith solutions published by four of the men on this List:\nThabit, Alhazen, Vieta, Conway.)\n&lt;/blockquote&gt;\n\n&lt;center&gt;&lt;font size=+0&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#top&quot;&gt;Top&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/center&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;a NAME=&quot;Archytas&quot; title=&quot;Ranked at &amp;nbsp; #43&quot;&gt;&lt;font size=+1&gt;&lt;u&gt;&lt;font color=&quot;#a00000&quot;&gt;\n&lt;b&gt;Archytas&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/font&gt; of Tarentum&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/font&gt;\n(ca 420-350 BC) Greek domain&lt;/a&gt;\n&lt;blockquote&gt;Archytas was an important statesman as well\nas philosopher.  He studied under Philolaus of Croton,\nwas a friend of Plato, and tutored Eudoxus.\nIn addition to discoveries always attributed to him,\nhe may be the source of several of Euclid\'s theorems,\nand some works attributed to Eudoxus and perhaps Pythagoras.\nRecently it has been shown that the magnificent &lt;i&gt;Mechanical Problems&lt;/i&gt;\nattributed to (pseudo-)Aristotle were probably actually written\nby Archytas, making him one of the greatest mathematicians\nof antiquity.\n&lt;p&gt;Archytas introduced &quot;motion&quot; to geometry, rotating curves to\nproduce solids.\nIf his writings had survived he\'d surely be considered one\nof the most brilliant and innovative geometers of antiquity.\nHe appears on Cardano\'s List of 12 Greatest Geniuses.\n(Euclid, Aristotle, Archimedes, Apollonius, Ptolemy,\nand the physician Galen of Pergamum\nare the other Greeks on that List.)\nArchytas\' most famous mathematical achievement was\n&quot;doubling the cube&quot; (constructing a line segment larger than\nanother by the factor cube-root of two).\nAlthough others solved the problem with\nother techniques, Archytas\' solution for cube doubling was astounding because\nit wasn\'t achieved in the plane, but involved the intersection\nof three-dimensional bodies.\nThis construction (which introduced the &lt;i&gt;Archytas Curve&lt;/i&gt;)\nhas been called &quot;a tour de force of the spatial imagination.&quot;\nHe invented the term &lt;i&gt;harmonic mean&lt;/i&gt; and worked with geometric means\nas well (proving that consecutive integers never have rational geometric mean).\nHe was a true polymath: he advanced the theory of music far beyond Pythagoras;\nstudied sound, optics and cosmology;\ninvented the pulley (and a rattle to occupy infants); wrote about\nthe lever; developed the curriculum called quadrivium;\nand is supposed to have built a steam-powered wooden bird which\nflew for 200 meters.\nArchytas is sometimes called the &quot;Father of Mathematical Mechanics.&quot;\n&lt;p&gt;Some scholars think Pythagoras and Thales are\npartly mythical.  If we take that view, Archytas (and Hippocrates)\nshould be promoted in this list.\n\n&lt;/blockquote&gt;\n\n&lt;center&gt;&lt;font size=+0&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#top&quot;&gt;Top&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/center&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;a NAME=&quot;Theaetetus&quot; title=&quot;Ranked at &amp;nbsp; #151 (tie)&quot;&gt;&lt;font size=+0&gt;&lt;u&gt;\n&lt;font color=&quot;#a00000&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;Theaetetus&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/u&gt; &amp;nbsp; of Athens&lt;/font&gt;\n(417-369 BC) Greece&lt;/a&gt;\n&lt;blockquote&gt;Theaetetus is presumed to be the true author\nof Books X and XIII of Euclid\'s &lt;i&gt;Elements&lt;/i&gt;, as well as some\nwork attributed to Eudoxus.

were first proved by Eudoxus.\nWhile Pythagoras had been horrified by the discovery of irrational\nnumbers, Eudoxus is famous for incorporating them into arithmetic.\nHe also developed the earliest techniques of the infinitesimal calculus;\nArchimedes credits Eudoxus with inventing a principle eventually called\nthe &lt;i&gt;Axiom of Archimedes&lt;/i&gt;:\nit avoids Zeno\'s paradoxes by, in effect, forbidding\ninfinities and infinitesimals.\nEudoxus\' work with irrational numbers, infinitesimals and limits\neventually inspired masters like Dedekind.\nEudoxus also introduced an &lt;i&gt;Axiom of Continuity&lt;/i&gt;;\nhe was a pioneer in solid geometry;\nand he developed his own solution to the Delian cube-doubling problem.\nEudoxus was the first great mathematical astronomer;\nhe developed the complicated ancient theory of planetary orbits;\nand may have invented the astrolabe.\nHe may have invented the 365.25-day calendar based on leap\nyears, though it remained for Julius Caesar to popularize it.\n(It is sometimes said that he knew that\nthe Earth rotates around the Sun, but that appears to be false;\nit is instead Aristarchus of Samos, as cited by Archimedes, who\nmay be the first &quot;heliocentrist.&quot;)\nOne of Eudoxus\' students was Menaechmus, who was first to\ndescribe the conic sections and used them to devise a non-Platonic\nsolution to the cube-doubling problem (and perhaps the\ncircle-squaring problem as well).\n\n&lt;p&gt;Four of Eudoxus\' most famous discoveries were the volume\nof a cone, extension of arithmetic to the irrationals, summing\nformula for geometric series, and\nviewing &lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;&amp;pi;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt; as the limit of polygonal perimeters.\nNone of these seems difficult today, but it does seem remarkable\nthat they were all first achieved by the same man.\nEudoxus has been quoted as saying\n&quot;Willingly would I burn to death like Phaeton, were this\nthe price for reaching the sun and learning its shape,\nits size and its substance.&quot;\n&lt;/blockquote&gt;\n\n&lt;center&gt;&lt;font size=+0&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#top&quot;&gt;Top&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/center&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;a NAME=&quot;Aristotle&quot;

one of these\n(which is seen only in Aristotle\'s work prior to Apollonius)\nis that a circle is the locus of points whose distances\nfrom two given points are in constant ratio.\nEven if, as is widely agreed, Aristotle\'s geometric theorems\nwere not his own work, his status as the most influential\nlogician and philosopher makes him a candidate for the List.\n&lt;/blockquote&gt;\n\n&lt;center&gt;&lt;font size=+0&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#top&quot;&gt;Top&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/center&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;a NAME=&quot;Euclid&quot;

Little else is known for certain about his life,\nbut several very important mathematical achievements are credited to him.\nHe was the first to prove that there are infinitely\nmany prime numbers; he produced an incomplete proof of\nthe Unique Factorization Theorem (Fundamental Theorem of Arithmetic);\nand he devised &lt;i&gt;Euclid\'s algorithm&lt;/i&gt; for computing gcd.\nHe introduced the Mersenne primes\nand observed that &lt;b&gt;(M&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;+M)/2&lt;/b&gt;\nis always perfect (in the sense of Pythagoras) if &lt;b&gt;M&lt;/b&gt; is Mersenne.\n(The converse, that any even perfect number has such a corresponding\nMersenne prime, was tackled by Alhazen and proven by Euler.)\nHis books contain many famous theorems, though much of the &lt;i&gt;Elements&lt;/i&gt;\nwas due to predecessors like Pythagoras (most of Books I and II),\nHippocrates (Book III), Theodorus, Eudoxus (Book V),\nArchytas (perhaps Book VIII) and Theaetetus.\nBook I starts with an elegant proof that rigid-compass constructions\ncan be implemented with a collapsing compass.\n(Given A, B, C, find CF = AB by first\nconstructing equilateral triangle ACD;\nthen use the compass to find E on AD with AE = AB;\nand finally find F on DC with DF = DE.)\nAlthough notions of trigonometry were not in use, Euclid\'s theorems\ninclude some closely related to the Laws of Sines and Cosines.\nAmong several books attributed to Euclid are\n&lt;i&gt;The Division of the\nScale&lt;/i&gt; (a mathematical discussion of music), &lt;i&gt;The Optics&lt;/i&gt;,\n&lt;i&gt;The Cartoptrics&lt;/i&gt; (a treatise on the theory of mirrors),\na book on spherical geometry, a book on logic fallacies,\nand his comprehensive math textbook &lt;i&gt;The Elements&lt;/i&gt;.\nSeveral of his masterpieces have been lost, including\nworks on conic sections and other advanced geometric topics.\nApparently Desargues\' Homology Theorem (a pair of triangles\nis coaxial if and only if it is copolar) was proved in one\nof these lost works; this is the fundamental theorem\nwhich initiated the study of projective geometry.\nEuclid ranks #14 on Michael Hart\'s famous list of\nthe Most Influential Persons in History.\n\n&lt;i&gt;The Elements&lt;/i&gt; introduced the notions of axiom and theorem;\nwas used as a textbook for 2000 years; and in fact is still the basis\nfor high school geometry, making\nEuclid the leading mathematics teacher of all time.\nSome think his best inspiration was recognizing that the\nParallel Postulate must be an axiom rather than a theorem.\n\n&lt;p&gt;There are many famous quotations about Euclid and his books.\nAbraham Lincoln abandoned his law studies when he didn\'t\nknow what &quot;demonstrate&quot; meant and &quot;went home to my father\'s house\n[to read Euclid], and stayed there till I could give any proposition\nin the six books of Euclid at sight.\nI then found out what demonstrate means, and went back to my law studies.&quot;\n&lt;/blockquote&gt;\n\n&lt;center&gt;&lt;font size=+0&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#top&quot;&gt;Top&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/center&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;a NAME=&quot;Archimedes&quot;

indicates that\nhe\'d partially anticipated the method of continued fractions.\nHe developed a recursive method of representing large\nintegers, and was first to note the law of exponents,\n&lt;b&gt;10&lt;sup&gt;a&lt;/sup&gt;&amp;middot;10&lt;sup&gt;b&lt;/sup&gt; = 10&lt;sup&gt;a+b&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/b&gt;.\nHe found a method to trisect an arbitrary angle (using\na &lt;i&gt;markable&lt;/i&gt; straightedge &amp;mdash; the construction is impossible\nusing strictly Platonic rules).\nOne of his most remarkable and famous geometric results\nwas determining the area of a parabolic section, for which\nhe offered two independent proofs, one\nusing his &lt;i&gt;Principle of the Lever&lt;/i&gt;,\nthe other using a geometric series.\nSome of Archimedes\' work survives only because Thabit ibn Qurra\ntranslated the otherwise-lost &lt;i&gt;Book of Lemmas&lt;/i&gt;; it contains\nthe angle-trisection method and several ingenious theorems\nabout inscribed circles.\n(Thabit shows how to construct a regular heptagon; it may not be\nclear whether this came from Archimedes, or was fashioned by Thabit\nby studying Archimedes\' angle-trisection method.)\nOther discoveries known only second-hand include\nthe &lt;i&gt;Archimedean semiregular solids&lt;/i&gt; reported by Pappus,\nand the Broken-Chord Theorem reported by Alberuni.\n\n&lt;p&gt;Archimedes and Newton might be the two best geometers ever, but\nalthough each produced ingenious geometric proofs, often they used\nnon-rigorous calculus to &lt;i&gt;discover&lt;/i&gt; results, and then devised\nrigorous geometric proofs for publication.\nHe used integral calculus\nto determine the centers of mass of hemisphere and cylindrical\nwedge, and the volume of two cylinders\' intersection.\nAlthough Archimedes didn\'t develop differentiation (integration\'s inverse),\nMichel Chasles credits him (along with Kepler, Cavalieri, and Fermat,\nwho all lived more than 18 centuries later)\nas one of the four who developed calculus before Newton and Leibniz.\nHe was one of the greatest mechanists ever: he laid a mathematical\nfoundation for the principles of leverage;\ndiscovered the first law of hydrostatics; and\ninvented the compound pulley, the hydraulic screwpump\n(called Archimedes\' screw), a\nminiature planetarium, and war machines (e.g. catapult and ship-burning\nmirrors).\n(Some of these inventions may predate Archimedes.\nOn the other hand, some scholars attribute the &lt;i&gt;Antikythera mechanism&lt;/i&gt;\nto Archimedes or his inspiration.)\nHis books include\n&lt;i&gt;Floating Bodies&lt;/i&gt;,\n&lt;i&gt;Spirals&lt;/i&gt;,\n&lt;i&gt;The Sand Reckoner&lt;/i&gt;,\n&lt;i&gt;Measurement of the Circle&lt;/i&gt;,\n&lt;i&gt;Sphere and Cylinder&lt;/i&gt;, \n&lt;i&gt;Plane Equilibriums&lt;/i&gt;,\n&lt;i&gt;Conoids and Spheroids&lt;/i&gt;,\n&lt;i&gt;Quadrature of Parabola&lt;/i&gt;,\nvarious now-lost works cited by Pappus or others,\npossibly &lt;i&gt;The Book of Lemmas&lt;/i&gt;,\nand (discovered only recently,\nand often called his most important work) &lt;i&gt;The Method&lt;/i&gt;.\nHe developed the &lt;i&gt;Stomachion&lt;/i&gt; puzzle (and solved a difficult\nenumeration problem involving it); other famous gems\ninclude &lt;i&gt;The Cattle-Problem&lt;/i&gt;.\n&lt;i&gt;The Book of Lemmas&lt;/i&gt; contains various geometric gems\n(&quot;the Salinon,&quot; &quot;the Shoemaker\'s Knife&quot;, etc.) and is credited\nto Archimedes by Thabit ibn Qurra but the attribution is disputed.\n\n&lt;p&gt;Archimedes discovered formulae for the volume and surface area\nof a sphere, and may even have been first to notice and prove the\nsimple relationship between a circle\'s circumference and area.\nFor these reasons,\n&lt;b&gt;&amp;pi;&lt;/b&gt; is often called &lt;i&gt;Archimedes\' constant&lt;/i&gt;.\nHis approximation &lt;b&gt;223/71 &lt; &amp;pi; &lt; 22/7&lt;/b&gt;\nwas the best of his day.\n(Apollonius soon surpassed it, but by using Archimedes\' method.)\nArchimedes\' Equiarea Map Theorem asserts that a sphere and its enclosing\ncylinder have equal surface area (as do the figures\' truncations).\nArchimedes also proved that the volume of that sphere is two-thirds the volume\nof the cylinder.\nHe requested that a representation of such a sphere and\ncylinder be inscribed on his tomb.\n\n&lt;p&gt;That Archimedes shared the attitude of later mathematicians like\nHardy and Brouwer is suggested by Plutarch\'s comment that Archimedes regarded\napplied mathematics &quot;as ignoble and sordid ... and did not deign\nto [write about his mechanical inventions; instead]\nhe placed his whole ambition in those speculations the beauty and subtlety of\nwhich are untainted by any admixture of the common needs of life.&quot;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Some of Archimedes\' greatest writings (including\n&lt;i&gt;The Method&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;Floating Bodies&lt;/i&gt;) are preserved only on a\npalimpsest rediscovered in 1906 and mostly deciphered only after 1998.\nIdeas unique to that work are an anticipation of Riemann\nintegration, calculating\nthe volume of a cylindrical wedge (previously first attributed to Kepler);\nalong with Oresme and Galileo he was among the few to comment\non the &quot;equinumerosity paradox&quot; (the fact that are as many perfect\nsquares as integers).\nAlthough Euler and Newton\nmay have been the most important mathematicians,\nand Gauss, Weierstrass and Riemann the greatest theorem provers,\nit is widely accepted that\nArchimedes was the greatest genius who ever lived.\nYet, Hart omits him altogether from his list of Most Influential Persons:\nArchimedes was simply &lt;i&gt;too&lt;/i&gt;

but these shapes were previously described\nby Menaechmus, and their names may also predate Apollonius.)\nAlthough astronomers eventually concluded it was not physically correct,\nApollonius developed the &quot;epicycle and deferent&quot;

he\ndeveloped spherical trigonometry,\nproduced trig tables, and more.\nHe produced at least fourteen texts of physics and mathematics\nnearly all of which have been lost, but which seem to\nhave had great teachings, including\nmuch of Newton\'s Laws of Motion.\nIn one obscure surviving work he demonstrates familiarity\nwith the combinatorial enumeration method now called Schr&amp;ouml;der\'s Numbers.\nHe invented the circle-conformal stereographic\nand orthographic map projections which carry his name.\nAs an astronomer, Hipparchus is credited with the discovery\nof equinox precession, length of the year, thorough\nstar catalogs, and invention\nof the armillary sphere and perhaps the astrolabe.\nHe had great historical influence in Europe, India and\nPersia, at least if credited also with Ptolemy\'s influence.\n(Hipparchus himself was influenced by Babylonian astronomers.)\nHipparchus\' work implies a better approximation to &lt;b&gt;&amp;pi;&lt;/b&gt;\nthan that of Apollonius, perhaps it was &lt;b&gt;&amp;pi;

(It took fifteen centuries\nbefore this irregularity was correctly attributed to Earth\'s elliptical orbit.)\n&lt;/blockquote&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;a name=&quot;Geocent&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;font size=+0&gt;&lt;u&gt;&lt;font color=&quot;#a00000&quot;&gt;\n&lt;b&gt;Geocentrism vs. Heliocentrism&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/font&gt;\n&lt;blockquote&gt;The mystery of celestial motions directed scientific inquiry for thousands\nof years.\nWith the notable exception of the Pythagorean Philolaus of Croton,\nthinkers generally assumed that the Earth was the center of the universe,\nbut this made it very difficult to explain the orbits of the other planets.\nThis problem had been considered by Eudoxus, Apollonius, and Hipparchus,\nwho developed a very complicated geocentric model involving\nconcentric spheres and epicyles.\nPtolemy perfected (or, rather, complicated) this model even further,\nintroducing \'equants\' to further fine-tune the orbital speeds;\nthis model was the standard for 14 centuries.\nWhile some Greeks, notably Aristarchus and Seleucus of Seleucia\n(and perhaps also Heraclides of Pontus or ancient Egyptians),\nproposed heliocentric models,\nthese were rejected because there was no parallax among stars.\n(Aristarchus guessed that the stars were at an almost unimaginable\ndistance, explaining the lack of parallax.\nAristarchus would be almost unknown except that\nArchimedes mentions, and assumes, Aristarchus\' heliocentrism in\n&lt;i&gt;The Sand Reckoner&lt;/i&gt;.\nI suspect that Archimedes accepted heliocentrism, but thought saying\nso openly would distract from his work.\nHipparchus was another ancient Greek who considered heliocentrism but,\nbecause he never guessed\nthat orbits were ellipses rather than cascaded circles, was unable to come\nup with a heliocentric model that fit his data.)\nAryabhata, Alhazen, Alberuni, Omar Khayy&amp;aacute;m, (perhaps some other\nIslamic mathematicians like al-Tusi), and Regiomontanus are\nother great pre-Copernican mathematicians who may have accepted\nthe possibility of heliocentrism. \n&lt;p&gt;The great skill demonstrated by Ptolemy and his predecessors in\ndeveloping their complex geocentric cosmology\nmay have &lt;i&gt;set back&lt;/i&gt; science since in fact\nthe Earth rotates around the Sun.\nThe geocentric models couldn\'t\nexplain the observed changes in the brightness of Mars or Venus,\nbut it was the phases of Venus, discovered by Galileo after the invention\nof the telescope, that finally led to general acceptance of heliocentrism. \n(Ptolemy\'s model predicted phases, but timed quite differently from\nGalileo\'s observations.)\n\n&lt;p&gt;Since the planets move without friction, their motions offer a pure\nview of the Laws of Motion; this is one reason that the heliocentric\nbreakthroughs of Copernicus, Kepler and Newton triggered the advances\nin mathematical physics which led to the Scientific Revolution.\n&lt;b&gt;Heliocentrism offered an even more key understanding&lt;/b&gt; that lead to\nmassive change in scientific thought.\nFor Ptolemy and other geocentrists, the &quot;fixed&quot; stars\nwere just lights on a sphere &lt;i&gt;rotating around the earth&lt;/i&gt;, but after\nthe Copernican Revolution the fixed stars were understood to be\nimmensely far away; this made it possible to imagine that they were\nthemselves suns, perhaps with planets of their own.  (Nicole Oresme\nand Nicholas of Cusa were pre-Copernican thinkers who wrote on both\nthe geocentric question and the possibility of other worlds.)\nThe Copernican perspective led\nGiordano Bruno and Galileo to posit a single common set of \nphysical laws which ruled both on Earth and in the Heavens.\n(It was this, rather than just the happenstance of planetary orbits,\nthat eventually most outraged the Roman Church....\nAnd we\'re getting ahead of our\nstory: Copernicus, Bruno, Galileo and Kepler lived 14 centuries after Ptolemy.)\n&lt;/blockquote&gt;\n\n&lt;center&gt;&lt;font size=+0&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#top&quot;&gt;Top&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/center&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;a NAME=&quot;Liu&quot;

Ancient Persians and Mayans &lt;i&gt;did&lt;/i&gt; have place-value\nnotation &lt;i&gt;with&lt;/i&gt; zero symbols, but neither qualify as inventing\na base-10 decimal system: Persia used the base-60 Babylonian system;\nMayans used base-20. \n(Another difference is that the Hindus had nine distinct digit symbols\nto go with their zero, while earlier place-value systems\nbuilt up from just two symbols: 1 and either 5 or 10.)\nThe Old Kingdom Egyptians did use a base-ten system, but it was\nsimilar to that of Greece and Vedic India:\n1, 10, 100 were depicted as separate symbols.\n&lt;p&gt;Conclusion: The decimal place-value system with zero symbol seems\nto be an obvious invention that in fact was very hard to invent.\nIf you insist on a single winner then India might be it.\nBut China, Babylonia, Persia and even the Mayans deserve Honorable Mention!\n&lt;/blockquote&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;a NAME=&quot;Aryabhatta&quot;

and worked as intended.)\nHe developed the mechanical theory of the arch;\nmade advances in anatomy, botany, and other fields of science;\ndeveloped an octant-based map projection;\nand he was first to conceive of plate tectonics.\nHe was also a poet and musician.\n&lt;p&gt;He had little formal training in mathematics until he was\nin his mid-40\'s, when he and Luca Pacioli (the other great Italian\nmathematician of that era) began tutoring each other.\nDespite this slow start, he did make novel achievements in mathematics:\nhe was first to note the simple classification of symmetry\ngroups on the plane, achieved interesting bisections\nand mensurations, advanced the craft of descriptive geometry,\nand developed an approximate solution\nto the circle-squaring problem.\nHe was first to discover the 60-vertex shape now called &quot;buckyball.&quot;\n(Leonardo is also widely credited with the elegant two-hexagon proof\nof the Pythagorean Theorem, but this authorship\nappears to be a myth.)\nAlong with Archimedes, Alberuni, Leibniz, and J.

contemplated astronomy;\nworked professionally as a church scholar and diplomat;\nand was also a painter.\nHe studied Islamic works on astronomy and geometry\nat the University of Bologna, and eventually wrote a book of great impact.\nAlthough his only famous theorem of mathematics (that certain trochoids are\nstraight lines) may have been derived from Oresme\'s work,\nor copied from Nasir al-Tusi,\nit was mathematical thought that led Copernicus to the conclusion\nthat the Earth rotates around the Sun.\nDespite opposition from the Roman church, this discovery\nled, via Galileo, Kepler and Newton, to the Scientific Revolution.\nFor this revolution, Copernicus is ranked #19 on Hart\'s List\nof the Most Influential Persons in History; however I think\nthere are several reasons why Copernicus\' importance may be exaggerated:\n(1) Copernicus\' system still used circles and epicycles, so it\nwas left to Kepler to discover the facts of elliptical orbits;\n(2) he retained the notion of a sphere of fixed stars,\nthus missing the unifying insight that our sun is one of many;\n(3) Giordano Bruno (1548-1600), who built on Copernicus\'\ndiscovery, was a better and more influential scientist,\nanticipating some of Galileo\'s concepts;\nand (4) the Scientific Revolution didn\'t really get underway\nuntil the invention of the telescope, which would have soon\nled to the discovery of heliocentrism in any event.\n\n&lt;p&gt;Until the Protestant Reformation, which began about the time\nof Copernicus\' discovery, European scientists were reluctant to challenge\nthe Catholic Church and its belief in geocentrism.\nCopernicus\' book was published only posthumously.\nIt remains controversial whether earlier Islamic or Hindu mathematicians\n(or even Archimedes with his &lt;i&gt;The Sand Reckoner&lt;/i&gt;)\nbelieved in heliocentrism, but\nwere also inhibited by religious orthodoxy.\n&lt;/blockquote&gt;\n\n&lt;center&gt;&lt;font size=+0&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#top&quot;&gt;Top&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/center&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;a NAME=&quot;Cardano&quot;

he wrote books on medicine and\nan encyclopedia of natural science.\n\n&lt;p&gt;But Cardano is most remembered for his achievements in mathematics.\nHe was first to publish general solutions\nto cubic and quartic equations,\nand first to publish the use of complex numbers in calculations.\n(Cardano\'s Italian colleagues deserve much credit:\nFerrari first solved the quartic, he or Tartaglia the cubic; and\nBombelli first treated the complex numbers as numbers in their own right.\nCardano may have been the &lt;i&gt;last&lt;/i&gt; great mathematician\nunwilling to deal with negative numbers: his treatment of cubic\nequations had to deal with &lt;i&gt;ax&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;

puzzle.\n(This puzzle may predate Cardano, and may even have been\nknown in ancient China.)\nDa Vinci and Galileo may have been more influential\nthan Cardano, but of the three great generalists\nin the century before Kepler, it seems clear that Cardano was the\nmost accomplished mathematician.\n\n&lt;p&gt;Cardano\'s life had tragic elements.\nThroughout his life he was tormented that his\nfather (a friend of Leonardo da Vinci) married\nhis mother only after Cardano was born.\n(And his mother tried several times to abort him.)\nCardano\'s reputation for gambling and aggression interfered\nwith his career.\nHe practiced astrology and was imprisoned for heresy\nwhen he cast a horoscope for Jesus.\n(This and other problems were due in part to\nrevenge by Tartaglia for Cardano\'s\nrevealing his secret algebra formulae.)\nHis son apparently murdered his own wife.\nLeibniz wrote of Cardano:\n&quot;Cardano was a great man with all his faults;\nwithout them, he would have been incomparable.&quot;\n&lt;/blockquote&gt;\n\n&lt;center&gt;&lt;font size=+0&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#top&quot;&gt;Top&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/center&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;a NAME=&quot;Bombelli&quot;

this apparently led to the end\nof the Huguenot Wars of Religion.\n\n&lt;p&gt;More importantly, Vieta was certainly\nthe best French mathematician prior to Descartes and Fermat.\nHe laid the groundwork for modern mathematics;\nhis works were the primary teaching for both Descartes and Fermat;\nIsaac Newton also studied Vieta.\nIn his role as a young tutor Vieta used decimal numbers before they\nwere popularized by Simon Stevin and may have guessed\nthat planetary orbits were ellipses before Kepler.\nVieta did work in geometry, reconstructing and publishing proofs\nfor Apollonius\' lost theorems, including all ten cases of the\ngeneral &lt;i&gt;Problem of Apollonius&lt;/i&gt;.\nVieta also used his new algebraic techniques\nto construct a regular heptagon.\nHe discovered several trigonometric identities including\na generalization of Ptolemy\'s Formula,\nthe latter (then called &lt;i&gt;prosthaphaeresis&lt;/i&gt;)\nproviding a calculation shortcut similar to logarithms in that\nmultiplication is reduced to\naddition (or exponentiation reduced to multiplication).\nVieta also used trigonometry to find real solutions\nto cubic equations for which the Italian methods had\nrequired complex-number arithmetic; he also used trigonometry\nto solve a particular 45th-degree equation that had been\nposed as a challenge.\nSuch trigonometric formulae revolutionized calculations and may\neven have helped stimulate the development and use of\nlogarithms by Napier and Kepler.\nHe developed the first infinite-product formula for &lt;b&gt;&amp;pi;&lt;/b&gt;.\nIn addition to his geometry and trigonometry, he also\nfound results in number theory, but\nVieta is most famous for his systematic use of decimal notation\nand variable letters, for which he is sometimes called the &quot;Father of\nModern Algebra.&quot;\n(Vieta used A,E,I,O,U for unknowns and consonants for parameters;\nit was Descartes who first used X,Y,Z for unknowns and A,B,C for parameters.)\nIn his works Vieta emphasized the relationships between algebraic\nexpressions and geometric constructions.\nOne key insight he had is that addends must be homogeneous\n(i.e., &quot;apples shouldn\'t be added to oranges&quot;), a seemingly trivial idea\nbut which can aid intuition even today.\n\n&lt;p&gt;Descartes, who once wrote &quot;I began where Vieta finished,&quot; is\nnow extremely famous, while Vieta is much less known.  (He isn\'t\n&lt;i&gt;even mentioned once&lt;/i&gt; in Bell\'s famous &lt;i&gt;Men of Mathematics&lt;/i&gt;.)\nMany would now agree this is due in large measure to Descartes\'\ndeliberate deprecations of competitors in his quest for personal glory.\n(Vieta wasn\'t particularly humble either, calling himself\nthe &quot;French Apollonius.&quot;)\n&lt;small&gt;\n&lt;pre&gt;\n&lt;tt&gt;\n    PI := 2\n    Y  := 0\n  LOOP:\n    Y  := SQRT(Y + 2)\n    PI := PI * 2 / Y\n    IF (&lt;i&gt;more precision needed&lt;/i&gt;) GOTO LOOP\n&lt;/tt&gt;\n&lt;/pre&gt;\n&lt;/small&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Vieta\'s formula for &lt;b&gt;&amp;pi;&lt;/b&gt; is clumsy to express\nwithout trigonometry, even with modern notation.\nEasiest may be to consider it the result of the BASIC program above.\nUsing this formula, Vieta constructed an approximation to &lt;b&gt;&amp;pi;&lt;/b&gt;\nthat was best-yet by a European, though not as accurate as al-Kashi\'s\ntwo centuries earlier.\n&lt;/blockquote&gt;\n\n&lt;center&gt;&lt;font size=+0&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#top&quot;&gt;Top&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/center&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;a NAME=&quot;Stevin&quot;

he also introduced the notion\nof relativity which later physicists found so fruitful.\n(Although he admired Galileo greatly, Einstein\'s famous result\nwas somewhat misnamed: it depended on the &lt;i&gt;absoluteness&lt;/i&gt;,\nnot relativity, of the speed of light.)\nGalileo discovered important principles of dynamics, including the\nessential notion that the vector sum of forces produce an\nacceleration.\n(Aristotle seems not to have considered the notion of acceleration,\nthough his successor Strato of Lampsacus did write on it.)\nGalileo may have been first to note that a larger body has less\nrelative cohesive strength than a smaller body.\nHe was a great inventor: in addition to being first to conceive\nof the pendulum clock, he developed a new type of pump,\nthe first compound-lens microscope,\nand the best telescope, thermometer, hydrostatic balance,\nand cannon sector of his day.\nAs a famous astronomer, Galileo\npointed out that Jupiter\'s Moons, which he discovered, provide\na natural clock and allow a universal time to be determined\nby telescope anywhere on Earth.\n(This was of little use in ocean navigation since a ship\'s rocking\nprevents the required delicate observations.\nGalileo tried to measure the speed of light, but it was too fast for\nhim.  However 66 years after Galileo discovered Jupiter\'s moons\nand proposed using them as a clock,\nthe astronomer Roemer inferred the speed of light from that \'clock\':\nthe clock had a discrepancy of up to seven minutes depending\non the Earth-Jupiter distance.)\nGalileo\'s other astronomical discoveries also included sunspots\nand lunar craters.\nHis discovery that Venus, like the Moon, had phases was the\ncritical fact which forced acceptance of Copernican heliocentrism.\nGalileo\'s contributions outside physics and astronomy\nwere also enormous:\nHe made discoveries with the microscope he invented, and\nmade several important contributions to the early\ndevelopment of biology.\nPerhaps Galileo\'s most important contribution\nwas the &lt;i&gt;Doctrine of Uniformity&lt;/i&gt;, the postulate that\nthere are &lt;i&gt;universal&lt;/i&gt; laws of mechanics, in contrast to\nAristotelian and religious notions\nof separate laws for heaven and earth.\n\n&lt;p&gt;Galileo is often called the &quot;Father of Modern Science&quot;\nbecause of his emphasis on experimentation.\nHis use of a ramp to discover his Law of Falling Bodies\nwas ingenious.\n(For his experiments he started with a water-clock to measure time,\nbut found the beats reproduced by trained musicians to be more convenient.)\nHe understood that results needed to be repeated and averaged\n(he minimized mean absolute-error for his curve-fitting \ncriterion, two centuries before Gauss and Legendre introduced\nthe mean squared-error criterion).\nFor his experimental methods and discoveries,\nhis laws of motion, and for (eventually) helping\nto spread Copernicus\' heliocentrism, Galileo may have been\nthe most influential scientist ever; he\nranks #12 on Hart\'s list of the Most Influential Persons in History.\n(Despite these comments, it does appear that Galileo ignored\nexperimental results that conflicted with his theories.\nFor example, the Law of the Pendulum, based on Galileo\'s incorrect\nbelief that the tautochrone was the circle, conflicted\nwith his own observations.\nSome of his other ideas were wrong; for example, he dismissed Kepler\'s\nelliptical orbits and notion of gravitation and published a\nvery faulty explanation of tides.)\nDespite his extreme importance to mathematical physics,\nGalileo doesn\'t usually appear on\nlists of greatest &lt;i&gt;mathematicians&lt;/i&gt;.\nHowever, Galileo did do work in pure mathematics;\nhe derived certain centroids and the parabolic shape\nof trajectories using a rudimentary calculus,\nand mentored Bonaventura Cavalieri, who extended Galileo\'s calculus;\nhe named (and may have been first to discover) the cycloid curve.\nMoreover, Galileo was one of the first to write about\ninfinite equinumerosity (the &quot;Hilbert\'s Hotel Paradox&quot;).\nGalileo once wrote &quot;Mathematics is the language in which God has written the\nuniverse.&quot;\n&lt;/blockquote&gt;\n\n&lt;center&gt;&lt;font size=+0&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#top&quot;&gt;Top&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/center&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;a NAME=&quot;Kepler&quot; title=&quot;Ranked at &amp;nbsp; #55&quot;&gt;&lt;font size=+1&gt;&lt;u&gt;\nJohannes&amp;nbsp; &lt;font color=&quot;#a00000&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;Kepler&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/font&gt;\n(1571-1630) Germany&lt;/a&gt;\n&lt;blockquote&gt;Kepler was interested in astronomy from an early age,\nstudied to become a Lutheran minister,\nbecame a professor of mathematics instead, then Tycho Brahe\'s understudy,\nand, on Brahe\'s death, was appointed Imperial Mathematician at\nthe age of twenty-nine.\nHis observations of the planets with Brahe, along with his study\nof Apollonius\' 1800-year old work, led to Kepler\'s three Laws\nof Planetary Motion, which in turn led directly to Newton\'s\nLaws of Motion.\nBeyond his discovery of these Laws (one of the most important\nachievements in all of science), Kepler is also sometimes called\nthe &quot;Founder of Modern Optics.&quot;\nHe furthered the theory of the camera obscura,\ntelescopes built from &lt;i&gt;two&lt;/i&gt; convex lenses,\nand atmospheric refraction.\nThe question of human vision had been\nconsidered by many great scientists including Aristotle, Euclid,\nPtolemy, Galen, Alkindus, Alhazen, and Leonardo da Vinci,\nbut it was Kepler who was first to explain the\noperation of the human eye correctly and to note that retinal\nimages will be upside-down.\nKepler developed a rudimentary notion of universal gravitation,\nand used it to produce the best explanation for tides before Newton;\nhowever he seems not to have noticed that his empirical laws\nimplied inverse-square gravitation.\nKepler ranks #75 on Michael Hart\'s famous list of\nthe Most Influential Persons in History.  This rank, much lower than\nthat of Copernicus, Galileo or Newton, seems to me to underestimate Kepler\'s\nimportance, since it was Kepler\'s Laws, rather than just heliocentrism,\nwhich were essential to the early development of mathematical physics.\n\n&lt;p&gt;According to Kepler\'s Laws, the planets move at variable speed\nalong ellipses.\n(Even Copernicus thought the orbits could be described with only circles.)\nThe Earth-bound observer is himself describing\nsuch an orbit and in almost the same plane as the planets;\nthus discovering the Laws would be a difficult challenge even for\nsomeone armed with computers and modern mathematics.\n(The very famous Kepler Equation relating a planet\'s\neccentric and anomaly is just one tool Kepler needed to develop.)\nKepler understood the importance of his remarkable discovery, even if\ncontemporaries like Galileo did not, writing:\n&lt;blockquote&gt;\n&quot;I give myself up to divine ecstasy ... My book is written.\nIt will be read either by my contemporaries or by posterity &amp;mdash;\nI care not which.  It may well wait a hundred years for a\nreader, as God has waited 6,000 years for someone to\nunderstand His work.&quot;\n&lt;/blockquote&gt;\nKepler also once wrote &quot;Mathematics is the archetype of the\nbeautiful.&quot;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Besides the trigonometric results needed to discover his Laws,\nKepler made other contributions to mathematics.\nHe generalized Alhazen\'s Billiard Problem, developing the\nnotion of curvature.\nHe was first to notice that the set of Platonic regular solids\nwas incomplete if concave solids are admitted, and first\nto prove that there were only 13 &lt;i&gt;Archimedean solids&lt;/i&gt;.\nHe proved theorems of solid geometry later discovered on\nthe famous palimpsest of Archimedes.\nHe rediscovered the Fibonacci series, applied it to\nbotany, and noted that the ratio of Fibonacci numbers\nconverges to the &lt;i&gt;Golden Mean&lt;/i&gt;.\nHe was a key early pioneer in calculus,\nand embraced the concept of continuity\n(which others avoided due to Zeno\'s paradoxes);\nhis work was a direct inspiration for Cavalieri and others.\nHe developed the theory of logarithms and improved on\nNapier\'s tables.\nHe developed mensuration methods and\nanticipated Fermat\'s theorem on stationary points.\nKepler once had an opportunity to buy wine, which merchants measured\nusing a shortcut; with the famous &lt;i&gt;Kepler\'s Wine Barrel Problem&lt;/i&gt;,\nhe used his rudimentary calculus to deduce which barrel shape\nwould be the best bargain.\n\n&lt;p&gt;Kepler reasoned that the structure of snowflakes was evidence\nfor the then-novel atomic theory of matter.\nHe noted that the obvious packing of cannonballs gave maximum\ndensity (this became known as &lt;i&gt;Kepler\'s Conjecture&lt;/i&gt;; optimality\nwas proved among regular packings by Gauss, but it wasn\'t until\n1998 that the possibility of denser &lt;i&gt;irregular&lt;/i&gt; packings\nwas disproven).\nIn addition to his physics and mathematics,\nKepler wrote a science fiction novel,\nand was an astrologer and mystic.\nHe had ideas similar to Pythagoras about numbers ruling the\ncosmos (writing that the purpose of studying the world\n&quot;should be to discover the rational order and harmony which\nhas been imposed on it by God and which He revealed to us in the language of\nmathematics&quot;).\nKepler\'s mystic beliefs even led to his own mother being\nimprisoned for witchcraft.\n\n&lt;p&gt;Johannes Kepler (along with Galileo, Fermat,\nHuygens, Wallis, Vieta and Descartes)\nis among the giants on whose shoulders Newton was proud to stand.\nSome historians place him ahead of Galileo and Copernicus as the single most\nimportant contributor to the early Scientific Revolution.\nChasles includes Kepler on a list of the six responsible for\nconceiving and perfecting infinitesimal calculus (the other five are\nArchimedes, Cavalieri, Fermat, Leibniz and Newton).\n(&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.keplersdiscovery.com/&quot;&gt;www.keplersdiscovery.com&lt;/a&gt;\nis a wonderful website devoted to Johannes Kepler\'s discoveries.)\n&lt;/blockquote&gt;\n\n&lt;center&gt;&lt;font size=+0&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#top&quot;&gt;Top&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/center&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;a NAME=&quot;Desargues&quot;

Some of his work was borrowed from others,\ne.g. from Thomas Harriot.\nHe had only insulting things to say about Pascal and Fermat,\neach of whom was much more\nbrilliant at mathematics than Descartes.\n(Some even suspect that Descartes arranged the destruction\nof Pascal\'s lost &lt;i&gt;Essay on Conics&lt;/i&gt;.)\nAnd Descartes made numerous errors in his development of\nphysics, perhaps even delaying science,\nwith Huygens writing &quot;in all of [Descartes\'] physics,\nI find almost nothing to which I can subscribe as being correct.&quot;\nEven the historical importance of his mathematics\nmay be somewhat exaggerated since others, e.g.\nFermat, Wallis and Cavalieri, were making similar discoveries\nindependently.\n&lt;/blockquote&gt;\n\n&lt;center&gt;&lt;font size=+0&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#top&quot;&gt;Top&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/center&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;a NAME=&quot;Caval&quot; title=&quot;Ranked at &amp;nbsp; #68&quot;&gt;&lt;font size=+1&gt;&lt;u&gt;\nBonaventura Francesco de&amp;nbsp; &lt;font color=&quot;#a00000&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;Cavalieri&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/font&gt;\n(1598-1647) Italy&lt;/a&gt;\n&lt;blockquote&gt;Cavalieri worked in analysis, geometry\nand trigonometry (e.g. discovering a formula for the area of a spherical\ntriangle), but is most famous for publishing\nworks on his &quot;principle of indivisibles&quot; (calculus);\nthese were very influential\nand inspired further development by Huygens, Wallis and Barrow.\n(His calculus was partly anticipated by Galileo, Kepler and Luca Valerio,\nand developed independently, though left unpublished, by Fermat.)\nAmong his theorems in this calculus was\n&lt;br&gt; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;lim&lt;/i&gt; &lt;sub&gt;(n&amp;rarr;&amp;infin;)&lt;/sub&gt;\n(1&lt;sup&gt;m&lt;/sup&gt;+2&lt;sup&gt;m&lt;/sup&gt;+ ... +n&lt;sup&gt;m&lt;/sup&gt;)\n/ n&lt;sup&gt;m+1&lt;/sup&gt; = 1 / (m+1)&lt;/b&gt;\n&lt;br&gt;Cavalieri also worked in theology, astronomy, mechanics and optics;\nhe was an inventor, and published logarithm tables.\nHe wrote several books, the first one developing the\nproperties of mirrors shaped as conic sections.\nHis name is especially remembered for Cavalieri\'s\nPrinciple of Solid Geometry.\nGalileo said of Cavalieri, &quot;Few, if any, since Archimedes, have delved\nas far and as deep into the science of geometry.&quot;\n&lt;/blockquote&gt;\n\n&lt;center&gt;&lt;font size=+0&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#top&quot;&gt;Top&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/center&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;a NAME=&quot;Fermat&quot; title=&quot;Ranked at &amp;nbsp; #12&quot;&gt;&lt;font size=+2&gt;&lt;u&gt;\nPierre de&amp;nbsp; &lt;font color=&quot;#a00000&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;Fermat&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/font&gt;\n(1601-1665) France&lt;/a&gt;\n&lt;blockquote&gt;Pierre de Fermat was the most brilliant mathematician\nof his era and, along with Descartes, one of the most influential.\nAlthough mathematics was just his hobby (Fermat was a government lawyer),\nFermat practically founded Number Theory, and also played key\nroles in the discoveries of Analytic Geometry and Calculus.\nLagrange considered Fermat, rather than Newton or Leibniz, to be the \ninventor of calculus.\nFermat was first to study certain interesting curves,\ne.g. the &lt;i&gt;&quot;Witch of Agnesi&quot;&lt;/i&gt;.\nHe was also an excellent geometer (e.g. discovering a\ntriangle\'s &lt;i&gt;Fermat point&lt;/i&gt;),\nand (in collaboration with Blaise Pascal) discovered probability theory.\nFellow geniuses are the best judges of genius, and Blaise\nPascal had this to say of Fermat:\n&quot;For my part, I confess that [Fermat\'s researches about numbers]\nare far beyond me, and I am competent only to admire them.&quot;\nE.T. Bell wrote &quot;it can be argued that Fermat was\nat least Newton\'s equal as a pure mathematician.&quot;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Fermat\'s most famous discoveries in number theory\ninclude the ubiquitously-used &lt;i&gt;Fermat\'s Little Theorem&lt;/i&gt;;\nthe &lt;i&gt;n = 4&lt;/i&gt; case of\nhis conjectured &lt;i&gt;Fermat\'s Last Theorem&lt;/i&gt; (he may have\nproved the &lt;i&gt;n = 3&lt;/i&gt; case as well);\nand &lt;i&gt;Fermat\'s Christmas Theorem&lt;/i&gt;\n(that any prime (4n+1) can be represented as the sum of two\nsquares in exactly one way) which may be considered the\nmost difficult theorem of arithmetic which had been\nproved up to that date.\nFermat proved the Christmas Theorem with difficulty\nusing &quot;infinite descent,&quot; but details are unrecorded, so the\ntheorem is often named the &lt;i&gt;Fermat-Euler Prime Number Theorem&lt;/i&gt;,\nwith the first published proof being by Euler more than a century after\nFermat\'s claim.\nAnother famous conjecture by Fermat is that\nevery natural number is the sum of three triangle numbers,\nor more generally the sum of k k-gonal numbers.\nAs with his &quot;Last Theorem&quot; he claimed to have a proof but\ndidn\'t write it up.\n(This theorem was eventually proved by Lagrange for k=4,\nthe very young Gauss for k=3, and Cauchy for general k.\nDiophantus claimed the k=4 case but any proof has been lost.)\nI think Fermat\'s conjectures were impressive even if unproven,\nand that this great mathematician is often underrated.\n(Recall that his so-called &quot;Last Theorem&quot;\nwas actually just a private scribble.)\n\n&lt;p&gt;Fermat developed a system of analytic geometry which both\npreceded and surpassed that of Descartes; he developed methods of\ndifferential and integral calculus which Newton\nacknowledged as an inspiration.\nAlthough Kepler anticipated it, Fermat is credited with Fermat\'s\nTheorem on Stationary Points (&lt;i&gt;df(x)/dx = 0&lt;/i&gt; at function extrema),\nthe key to many problems in applied analysis.\nFermat was also the first European to find the integration\nformula for the general polynomial; he used his calculus\nto find centers of gravity, etc.\n\n&lt;p&gt;Fermat\'s contemporaneous rival Ren&amp;eacute; Descartes is more famous\nthan Fermat, and Descartes\' writings were more influential.\nWhatever one thinks of Descartes as a &lt;i&gt;philosopher&lt;/i&gt;,\nhowever, it seems clear that Fermat was the better &lt;i&gt;mathematician&lt;/i&gt;.\nFermat and Descartes did work in physics and independently discovered\nthe (trigonometric) law of refraction,\nbut Fermat gave the correct explanation, and used it\nremarkably to anticipate the Principle of Least Action\nlater enunciated by Maupertuis (though Maupertuis\nhimself, like Descartes, had an incorrect explanation of refraction).\nFermat and Descartes independently discovered analytic geometry,\nbut it was Fermat who extended it to more than\ntwo dimensions, and followed up by developing elementary calculus.\n&lt;/blockquote&gt;\n\n&lt;center&gt;&lt;font size=+0&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#top&quot;&gt;Top&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/center&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;a NAME=&quot;Roberval&quot;

he worked on analytic geometry independently of Descartes.\nWith his analysis he was able to solve several difficult geometric problems\ninvolving curved lines and solids, including results about the\ncycloid which were also credited to Pascal and Torricelli.\nSome of these methods, published posthumously, led to him being called the\nFounder of Kinematic Geometry.\nHe excelled at mechanics,\nworked in cartography, helped Pascal with vacuum experiments, and invented\nthe Roberval balance, still in use in weighing scales to this day.\nHe opposed Huygens in the early debate about gravitation,\nthough neither fully anticipated Newton\'s solution.\n&lt;/blockquote&gt;\n\n&lt;center&gt;&lt;font size=+0&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#top&quot;&gt;Top&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/center&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;a NAME=&quot;Torricelli&quot;

he also wrote on possible pitfalls\nin applying the new calculus.\nHe discovered &lt;i&gt;Gabriel\'s Horn&lt;/i&gt; with infinite surface area but finite\nvolume; this &quot;paradoxical&quot; result provoked much discussion at the time. \nHe also solved a problem due to Fermat by locating the isogonic center of\na triangle.\nTorricelli was a significant influence on the early scientific revolution;\nhad he lived longer, or published more, he would surely have become\none of the greatest mathematicians of his era.\n&lt;/blockquote&gt;\n\n&lt;center&gt;&lt;font size=+0&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#top&quot;&gt;Top&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/center&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;a NAME=&quot;Wallis&quot;

he built the first\nbalance spring watch, which he presented to his\npatron, King Louis XIV of France; he was first to give the\ncorrect &quot;equation of time&quot; relating sundial time to\nabsolute time.\nHe invented superior lens grinding techniques,\nthe achromatic eye-piece, and the best telescope of his day.\nHe was himself a famous astronomer:\nhe discovered Titan and was first to\nproperly describe Saturn\'s rings and the Orion Nebula.\nHe also designed, but never built, an internal combustion engine.\nHe promoted the use of an equal-tempered 31-tone music scale\nto avoid the tuning errors in Stevin\'s 12-tone scale;\na 31-tone organ was in use in Holland as late as the 20th century.\nHuygens was an excellent card player, billiard player,\nhorse rider, and wrote a book speculating about extra-terrestrial life.\n\n&lt;p&gt;As a mathematician, Huygens did brilliant work in analysis;\nhis calculus, along with that of Wallis, is considered the\nbest prior to Newton and Leibniz.\nHe also did brilliant work in geometry,\nproving theorems about conic sections, the cycloid and the catenary.\nHe was first to show that the cycloid solves the tautochrone\nproblem; he used this fact to design\npendulum clocks that would be more accurate\nthan ordinary pendulum clocks.\nHe was first to find the flaw in Saint-Vincent\'s\nthen-famous circle-squaring method;\nHuygens himself solved some related quadrature problems.\nHe introduced the concepts of evolute and involute.\nHis friendships with Descartes, Pascal, Mersenne and others helped\ninspire his mathematics; Huygens in turn was inspirational\nto the next generation.\nAt Pascal\'s urging, Huygens published the first real\ntextbook on probability theory; he also\nbecame the first practicing actuary.\n\n&lt;p&gt;Huygens had tremendous creativity, historical importance,\nand depth and breadth of genius, both in physics and mathematics.\nHe also was important for serving as tutor\nto the otherwise self-taught Gottfried Leibniz\n(who\'d &quot;wasted his youth&quot;

invented\na reflecting telescope; and is even\ncredited with using a bird feather as the first diffraction grating.\nBut James Gregory is most famous for his mathematics, making\nmany of the same discoveries as Newton did:\nthe Fundamental Theorem of Calculus,\ninterpolation method, and binomial theorem.\nHe developed the concept of Taylor\'s series and used it to\nsolve a famous semicircle division problem posed by Kepler\nand to develop trigonometric identities, including\n&lt;br&gt;

and Newton credits the First Law\nto Aristotle.\nHowever Newton was apparently the first person to conclude\nthat the ordinary gravity we observe on Earth is the very same\nforce that keeps the planets in orbit.\nHis Law of Universal Gravitation was revolutionary and due to\nNewton alone.\n(Christiaan Huygens, the other great mechanist of the era,\nhad independently deduced that Kepler\'s laws imply inverse-square\ngravitation, but he considered the action at a distance in\nNewton\'s theory to be &quot;absurd.&quot;)\nNewton published the Cooling Law of thermodynamics.\nHe also made contributions to chemistry, and was \nthe important early advocate of the atomic theory.\nHis writings also made important contributions\nto the general scientific method.\nHis other intellectual interests included theology,\nand mysticism.\nHe studied ancient Greek writers like Pythagoras,\nDemocritus, Lucretius, Plato; and claimed that the\nancients knew much, including the law of gravitation.\n\n&lt;p&gt;Although this list is concerned only with mathematics,\nNewton\'s greatness is indicated by the huge range of his\nphysics: even without his Laws of Motion, Gravitation and Cooling,\nhe\'d be famous just for his revolutionary work in optics, where\nhe explained diffraction, observed\nthat white light is a mixture of all the rainbow\'s colors,\nnoted that purple is created by combining red and\nblue light and, starting from that observation, \nwas first to conceive of a color hue &quot;wheel.&quot;\n(The mystery of the rainbow had been solved by earlier\nmathematicians like Al-Farisi and Descartes, but\nNewton improved on their explanations.  Most people\nwould count only six colors in the rainbow but, due to\nNewton\'s influence, seven -- a number with mystic importance --\nis the accepted number.  Supernumerary rainbows, by the way,\nwere not explained until the wave theory of light superceded\nNewton\'s theory.)\nHe noted that his dynamical laws were symmetric in time; that\njust as the past determines the future, so the\nfuture might, in principle, determine the past.\nNewton almost anticipated Einstein\'s mass-energy equivalence,\nwriting &quot;Gross Bodies and Light are convertible into one another...\n[Nature] seems delighted with Transmutations.&quot;\nOcean tides had intrigued several of Newton\'s predecessors; once\ngravitation was known, the Moon\'s gravitational attraction\nprovided the explanation -- except that there are &lt;i&gt;two&lt;/i&gt; high\ntides per day, one when the Moon is farthest away.\nWith clear thinking the second high tide is also explained by gravity\nbut who was the first clear thinker to produce that explanation?\nYou guessed it! Isaac Newton.\n(The theory of tides was later refined by Laplace.)\nNewton\'s earliest fame came when he designed the first reflecting telescope:\nby avoiding chromatic aberration, these were the best telescopes of that era.\nHe also designed the first reflecting microscope, and the sextant.\n\n&lt;p&gt;Although others also developed the techniques independently,\nNewton is regarded as the &quot;Father of Calculus&quot; (which he called\n&quot;fluxions&quot;); he shares credit with Leibniz for the\nFundamental Theorem of Calculus\n(that integration and differentiation are each other\'s inverse operation).\nHe applied calculus for several purposes:\nfinding areas, tangents, the lengths of\ncurves and the maxima and minima of functions.\nAlthough Descartes is renowned as the inventor of analytic geometry,\nhe and followers like Wallis were reluctant even to use negative\ncoordinates, so one historian declares Newton to be &quot;the first\nto work boldly with algebraic equations.&quot;\nIn addition to several other important advances in analytic geometry,\nhis mathematical works include the Binomial Theorem,\nhis eponymous interpolation method,\nthe idea of polar coordinates,\nand power series for exponential and trigonometric functions.\n(His equation &amp;nbsp;\n&lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;e&lt;/i&gt;&lt;sup&gt;x&lt;/sup&gt; = &lt;i&gt;&amp;sum;&lt;/i&gt; x&lt;sup&gt;k&lt;/sup&gt; / k!&lt;/b&gt; &amp;nbsp;\nhas been called the &quot;most important series in mathematics.&quot;)\nHe contributed to algebra and the theory of equations;\nhe was first to state B&amp;eacute;zout\'s Theorem;\nhe generalized Descartes\' rule of signs.\n(The generalized rule of signs was incomplete and finally\nresolved two centuries later by Sturm and Sylvester.)\nHe developed a series for the arcsin function.\nHe developed facts about cubic equations\n(just as the &quot;shadows of a cone&quot; yield all quadratic curves,\nNewton found a curve whose &quot;shadows&quot; yield all cubic curves).\nHe proved, using a purely geometric argument of awesome ingenuity,\nthat same-mass spheres (or hollowed spheres) of any radius have equal\ngravitational attraction: this fact is key to celestial motions.\n(He also proved that objects &lt;i&gt;inside&lt;/i&gt; a hollowed sphere\nexperience zero net attraction.)\nHe discovered Puiseux series almost two centuries before they\nwere re-invented by Puiseux.\n(Like some of the greatest ancient mathematicians,\nNewton took the time to compute an approximation to\n&lt;b&gt;&amp;pi;&lt;/b&gt;; his was better than Vieta\'s, though still\nnot as accurate as al-Kashi\'s.)\n\n&lt;p&gt;Newton is so famous for his calculus, optics, and laws of\ngravitation and motion, it is easy to overlook that he was also one of the\nvery greatest geometers.\nHe was first to fully solve\nthe famous Problem of Pappus, and did so with pure geometry.\nBuilding on the &quot;neusis&quot; (non-Platonic) constructions of Archimedes\nand Pappus, he demonstrated cube-doubling and that angles\ncould be &lt;i&gt;k&lt;/i&gt;-sected for any &lt;i&gt;k&lt;/i&gt;, if one is allowed a conchoid or\ncertain other mechanical curves.\nHe also built on Apollonius\' famous\ntheorem about tangent circles to develop the technique\nnow called hyperbolic trilateration.\nDespite the power of Descartes\' analytic geometry,\nNewton\'s achievements with synthetic geometry were surpassing.\nEven before the invention of the calculus of variations, Newton\nwas doing difficult work in that field, e.g.\nhis calculation of the &quot;optimal bullet shape.&quot;\nHis other marvelous geometric theorems included several about quadrilaterals\nand their in- or circum-scribing ellipses.\nHe constructed the parabola defined by four given points,\nas well as various cubic curve constructions.\n(As with Archimedes, many of \nNewton\'s constructions used non-Platonic tools.)\nHe anticipated Poncelet\'s Principle of Continuity.\nAn anecdote often cited to demonstrate his brilliance is the problem\nof the &lt;i&gt;brachistochrone&lt;/i&gt;, which had baffled the best mathematicians in\nEurope, and came to Newton\'s attention late in life.\nHe solved it in a few hours and published the answer anonymously.\nBut on seeing the solution Jacob Bernoulli immediately exclaimed\n&quot;I recognize the lion by his footprint.&quot;\n\n&lt;p&gt;In 1687 Newton published&amp;nbsp;\n&lt;i&gt;Philosophiae Naturalis Principia Mathematica&lt;/i&gt;, surely\nthe greatest scientific book ever written.\nThe motion of the planets was not understood before Newton,\nalthough the &lt;i&gt;heliocentric&lt;/i&gt; system allowed Kepler to describe the\norbits.\nIn &lt;i&gt;Principia&lt;/i&gt; Newton analyzed the consequences of his Laws of Motion\nand introduced the Law of Universal Gravitation.\nWith the key mystery of celestial motions finally resolved,\nthe Great Scientific Revolution began.\n(In his work Newton also proved important theorems about inverse-&lt;i&gt;cube&lt;/i&gt;\nforces, work largely unappreciated until Chandrasekhar\'s modern-day work.)\nNewton once wrote &quot;Truth is ever to be found in the simplicity,\nand not in the multiplicity and confusion of things.&quot;\nSir Isaac Newton was buried at Westminster Abbey in a tomb\ninscribed &quot;Let mortals rejoice that so great an ornament to the human\nrace has existed.&quot;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Newton ranks #2 on Michael Hart\'s famous list of\nthe Most Influential Persons in History.\n(Muhammed the Prophet of Allah is #1.)\nWhatever the criteria, Newton would certainly rank first\nor second on any list of physicists, or scientists in general,\nbut some listmakers would demote him slightly on a list of\npure mathematicians:\nhis emphasis was physics not mathematics,\nand the contribution of Leibniz\n(Newton\'s rival for the title &lt;i&gt;Inventor of Calculus&lt;/i&gt;)\nlessens the historical importance of Newton\'s calculus.\nOne reason I\'ve ranked him at #1 is a comment by\nGottfried Leibniz himself:\n&quot;Taking mathematics from the beginning of the world to the time when\nNewton lived, what he has done is much the better part.&quot;\n&lt;/blockquote&gt;\n\n&lt;center&gt;&lt;font size=+0&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#top&quot;&gt;Top&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/center&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;a NAME=&quot;Leibniz&quot;

and his influence in mathematics (especially\nhis co-invention of the infinitesimal calculus) was immense.\nHis childhood IQ has been estimated as second-highest in all of history,\nbehind only Goethe\'s.\nDescriptions which have been applied to Leibniz include\n&quot;one of the two greatest universal geniuses&quot; (da Vinci was\nthe other); &quot;the most important logician between Aristotle and Boole;&quot;\nand the &quot;Father of Applied Science.&quot;\nLeibniz described himself as &quot;the most teachable of mortals.&quot;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Mathematics was just a self-taught sideline for Leibniz, who was\na philosopher, lawyer, historian, diplomat and renowned inventor.\nBecause he &quot;wasted his youth&quot; before learning mathematics,\nhe probably ranked behind the Bernoullis as well as Newton\nin pure mathematical talent, and thus he may be the only\nmathematician among the Top Fifteen who was never the greatest\nliving algorist or theorem prover.\nI won\'t try to summarize Leibniz\' contributions to philosophy\nand diverse other fields including biology; as just\nthree examples: he predicted the Earth\'s molten core,\nintroduced the notion of subconscious mind,\nand built the first calculator that could do multiplication.\nLeibniz also had political influence: he\nconsulted to both the Holy Roman and Russian Emperors;\nanother of his patrons was Sophia Wittelsbach (Electress of Hanover),\nwho was only distantly in\nline for the British throne, but was made Heir Presumptive.\n(Sophia died before Queen Anne, but her son\nwas crowned King George I of England.)\n\n&lt;p&gt;Leibniz pioneered the common discourse of mathematics,\nincluding its continuous, discrete, and symbolic aspects.\n(His ideas on symbolic logic weren\'t pursued and it was left\nto Boole to reinvent this almost two centuries later.)\nMathematical innovations attributed to Leibniz include\nthe notations &amp;int;&lt;b&gt;f(x)&lt;i&gt;d&lt;/i&gt;x&lt;/b&gt;,\n&lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;d&lt;/i&gt;f(x)/&lt;i&gt;d&lt;/i&gt;x&lt;/b&gt;, &lt;b&gt;&amp;#8731;x&lt;/b&gt;,\nand even the use of &lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;a&amp;middot;b&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt; (instead of\n&lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;a&lt;/i&gt; X &lt;/i&gt;b&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/i&gt;) for multiplication;\nthe concepts of matrix determinant and Gaussian elimination;\nthe theory of geometric envelopes;\nand the binary number system.\nHe worked in number theory, conjecturing Wilson\'s Theorem.\nHe invented more mathematical terms than anyone, including\n&lt;i&gt;function&lt;/i&gt;, &lt;i&gt;analysis situ&lt;/i&gt;, &lt;i&gt;variable&lt;/i&gt;, &lt;i&gt;abscissa&lt;/i&gt;,\n&lt;i&gt;parameter&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;coordinate&lt;/i&gt;.\nHe also coined the word &lt;i&gt;transcendental&lt;/i&gt;, proving that\nsin() was not an algebraic function.\nHis works seem to anticipate cybernetics and information theory;\nand Mandelbrot acknowledged Leibniz\' anticipation of self-similarity.\nLike Newton, Leibniz discovered The Fundamental Theorem of Calculus;\nhis contribution to calculus was much more influential than Newton\'s,\nand his superior notation is used to this day.\nAs Leibniz himself pointed out, since the concept of\nmathematical analysis was already known to ancient Greeks,\nthe revolutionary invention was the &lt;u&gt;notation&lt;/u&gt; (&quot;&lt;i&gt;calculus&lt;/i&gt;&quot;),\nbecause with &quot;symbols [which] express the exact nature of a\nthing briefly ... the labor of thought is wonderfully diminished.&quot;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Leibniz\' thoughts on mathematical physics had some influence.\nHe was one of the first to articulate the law of energy\nconservation and may have written on the principle of least action.\nHe developed laws of motion that gave different insights\nfrom those of Newton; his views on cosmology anticipated theories\nof Mach and Einstein and are more in accord with modern\nphysics than are Newton\'s views.\nMathematical physicists influenced by Leibniz include not only Mach,\nbut perhaps Hamilton and Poincar&amp;eacute; themselves.\n\n&lt;p&gt;Although others found it independently\n(including perhaps Madhava three centuries earlier),\nLeibniz discovered and proved a striking identity\nfor &lt;b&gt;&amp;pi;&lt;/b&gt;:\n&lt;br&gt;

problem (what shape does a clothesline take?)\nbecame more famous than the &quot;tautochrone&quot; solved by Huygens.\nPerhaps the most famous of such problems\nwas the brachistochrone, wherein Jacob recognized\nNewton\'s &quot;lion\'s paw&quot;, and about which Johann Bernoulli wrote:\n&quot;You will be petrified with astonishment [that]\nthis same cycloid, the tautochrone of Huygens,\nis the brachistochrone we are seeking.&quot;\nJacob did significant work outside calculus;\nin fact his most famous work was the &lt;i&gt;Art of Conjecture&lt;/i&gt;,\na textbook on probability and combinatorics which\nproves the Law of Large Numbers, the Power Series Equation,\nand introduces the Bernoulli numbers.\nHe is credited with the invention of polar coordinates (though\nNewton and Alberuni had also discovered them).\nJacob also did outstanding work in geometry, for example constructing\nperpendicular lines which quadrisect a triangle.\n&lt;/blockquote&gt;\n\n&lt;center&gt;&lt;font size=+0&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#top&quot;&gt;Top&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/center&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;a NAME=&quot;Jbernou&quot;

for example,\nletting p(n) denote the number of partitions of n, Euler found \nthe lovely equation: &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp;\n&lt;b&gt;&amp;Sigma;&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt; &lt;i&gt;p&lt;/i&gt;(n) x&lt;sup&gt;n&lt;/sup&gt;\n= 1 / &amp;Pi;&lt;sub&gt;k&lt;/sub&gt;

form; Euler found an ingenious proof of this.\n\n&lt;p&gt;Euler was a very major figure in number theory: He proved that the\nsum of the reciprocals of primes less than x is approx. (&lt;i&gt;ln ln&lt;/i&gt; x),\ninvented the totient function and used it to generalize\nFermat\'s Little Theorem,\nfound both the largest then-known prime\nand the largest then-known perfect number,\nproved &lt;b&gt;e&lt;/b&gt; to be irrational,\ndiscovered (though without complete proof) a\nbroad class of transcendental numbers,\nproved that all even perfect numbers\nmust have the Mersenne number form that Euclid had\ndiscovered 2000 years earlier, and much more.\nEuler was also first to prove several interesting theorems\nof geometry, including facts about the &lt;i&gt;9-point Feuerbach circle&lt;/i&gt;;\nrelationships among a triangle\'s altitudes, medians, and\ncircumscribing and inscribing circles;\nthe famous Intersecting Chords Theorem;\nand an expression for a tetrahedron\'s volume in terms of its edge lengths.\nEuler was first to explore topology, proving theorems\nabout the &lt;i&gt;Euler characteristic&lt;/i&gt;, and the famous\nEuler\'s Polyhedral Theorem, &lt;b&gt;F+V = E+2&lt;/b&gt; (although it may have\nbeen discovered by Descartes and first proved rigorously by Jordan).\nAlthough noted as the first great &quot;pure mathematician,&quot;\nEuler\'s pump and turbine equations revolutionized the design of pumps;\nhe also made important contributions to music theory,\nacoustics, optics, celestial motions, fluid dynamics, and mechanics.\nHe extended Newton\'s Laws of Motion to rotating rigid bodies;\nand developed the Euler-Bernoulli beam equation.\nOn a lighter note, Euler constructed a particularly\n&quot;magical&quot; magic square.\n\n&lt;p&gt;Euler combined his brilliance with phenomenal concentration.\nHe developed the first method to estimate the Moon\'s orbit (the three-body\nproblem which had stumped Newton), and he settled an arithmetic\ndispute involving 50 terms in a long convergent series.\nBoth these feats were accomplished when he was totally blind.\n(About this he said &quot;Now I will have less distraction.&quot;)\nFran&amp;ccedil;ois Arago said that &quot;Euler calculated without apparent effort,\nas men breathe, or as eagles sustain themselves in the wind.&quot;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Four of the most important constant symbols in mathematics\n(&lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;&amp;pi;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;, &lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;e&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;,\n&lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;i&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;

Clairaut participated in Maupertuis\' expedition to Lappland to\nmeasure the polar regions.\nMeasurements at high latitudes showed the poles to be flattened:\nNewton was right.\nClairaut worked on the theories of ellipsoids and the three-body\nproblem, e.g. Moon\'s orbit.\nThat orbit was the major mathematical challenge of the day,\nand there was great difficulty reconciling theory and observation.\nIt was Clairaut who finally resolved this,\nby approaching the problem with more rigor than others.\nWhen Euler finally understood Clairaut\'s solution he called it\n&quot;the most important and profound discovery that has ever\nbeen made in mathematics.&quot;\nLater, when Halley\'s Comet reappeared as he had predicted,\nClairaut was acclaimed as &quot;the new Thales.&quot;\n&lt;/blockquote&gt;\n\n&lt;center&gt;&lt;font size=+0&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#top&quot;&gt;Top&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/center&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;a NAME=&quot;Alembert&quot;

differential equations;\nto solve the resultant linear systems,\nhe effectively invented the method of eigenvalues;\nhe also anticipated the Cauchy-Riemann Equations.\nThese are the same techniques in use for many problems\nin physics to this day.\nD\'Alembert was also a forerunner in functions of a complex variable,\nand the notions of infinitesimals and limits.\nWith his treatises on dynamics, elastic collisions,\nhydrodynamics, cause of winds, vibrating strings,\ncelestial motions, refraction, etc., the\nyoung Jean le Rond easily surpassed the efforts of his older\nrival, Daniel Bernoulli.\nHe may have been first to speak of time as a &quot;fourth dimension.&quot;\n(Rivalry with the Swiss mathematicians led to d\'Alembert\'s\nsometimes being unfairly ridiculed, although it does seem true that\nd\'Alembert had very incorrect notions of probability.)\n\n&lt;p&gt;D\'Alembert was first to prove that every\npolynomial has a complex root; this is now called the\nFundamental Theorem of Algebra.\n(In France this Theorem is called the D\'Alembert-Gauss Theorem.\nAlthough Gauss was first to provide a fully rigorous proof,\nd\'Alembert\'s proof preceded, and was more nearly complete\nthan, the attempted proof by Euler-Lagrange.)\nHe also did creative\nwork in geometry (e.g. anticipating Monge\'s Three Circle Theorem),\nand was principal creator of the major encyclopedia of his day.\nD\'Alembert wrote &quot;The imagination in a mathematician who creates\nmakes no less difference than in a poet who invents.&quot;\n&lt;/blockquote&gt;\n\n&lt;center&gt;&lt;font size=+0&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#top&quot;&gt;Top&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/center&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;a NAME=&quot;Lambert&quot;

(Would Jupiter\'s pull on Saturn\neventually propel Saturn into a closer orbit, or was\nSaturn\'s orbit stable for eternity?)\nLaplace\'s equations had the optimistic outcome that the solar\nsystem was stable.\n\n&lt;p&gt;Laplace advanced the nebular hypothesis of solar system origin, and\nwas first to conceive of black holes.\n(He also conceived of multiple galaxies,\nbut this was Lambert\'s idea first.)\nHe explained the so-called secular acceleration of the Moon.\n(Today we know Laplace\'s theories do not\nfully explain the Moon\'s path, nor guarantee orbit stability.)\nHis other accomplishments in physics include theories about\nthe speed of sound and surface tension.\nHe worked closely with Lavoisier, helping to discover the elemental\ncomposition of water, and the natures\nof combustion, respiration and heat itself.\nLaplace may have been first to note that the laws of mechanics\nare the same with time\'s arrow reversed.\nHe was noted for his strong belief in determinism, famously replying to\nNapoleon\'s question about God with: &quot;I have no need of that hypothesis.&quot;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Laplace viewed mathematics as just a tool for developing his\nphysical theories.\nNevertheless, he made many important mathematical discoveries\nand inventions (although the Laplace Transform itself\nwas already known to Lagrange).\nHe was the premier expert at differential and difference equations,\nand definite integrals.\nHe developed spherical harmonics, potential theory, and the\ntheory of determinants;

Could its orbit be predicted well enough\nto rediscover it on re-emergence?  Laplace, one of the most\nrespected mathematicians of the time, declared it impossible.\nGauss became famous when he used an 8th-degree polynomial equation\nto successfully predict Ceres\' orbit.\nGauss also did important work in several areas of physics,\ndeveloped an important modification to Mercator\'s map projection,\ninvented the heliotrope, and co-invented the telegraph.\n\n&lt;p&gt;Much of Gauss\'s work wasn\'t published: unbeknownst to his colleagues it was\nGauss who first discovered non-Euclidean geometry (even\nanticipating Einstein by suggesting physical space\nmight not be Euclidean),\ndoubly periodic elliptic functions,\na prime distribution formula,\nquaternions, foundations of topology, the Law of Least Squares,\nDirichlet\'s class number formula,\nthe key Bonnet\'s Theorem of differential geometry\n(now usually called Gauss-Bonnet Theorem),\nthe butterfly procedure for rapid calculation of Fourier series,\nand even the rudiments of knot theory.\nGauss was first to prove the Fundamental Theorem of Functions of\na Complex Variable (that the line-integral over a closed\ncurve of a monogenic function is zero),\nbut he let Cauchy take the credit.\nGauss was very prolific, and may be the most\nbrilliant theorem prover who ever lived, so many would rank him #1.\nBut several others on the list had more &lt;i&gt;historical&lt;/i&gt; importance.\nAbel hints at a reason for this:\n&quot;[Gauss] is like the fox, who effaces his tracks in the sand.&quot;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Gauss once wrote &quot;It is not knowledge, but the act of learning, ...\nwhich grants the greatest enjoyment.\nWhen I have clarified and exhausted a subject,\nthen I turn away from it, in order to go into darkness again ...&quot;\n&lt;/blockquote&gt;\n\n&lt;center&gt;&lt;font size=+0&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#top&quot;&gt;Top&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/center&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;a NAME=&quot;Poisson&quot; title=&quot;Ranked at &amp;nbsp; #94&quot;&gt;&lt;font size=+1&gt;&lt;u&gt;\nSim&amp;eacute;on Denis&amp;nbsp; &lt;font color=&quot;#a00000&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;Poisson&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/font&gt;\n(1781-1840) France&lt;/a&gt;\n&lt;blockquote&gt;Sim&amp;eacute;on Poisson was a prot&amp;eacute;g&amp;eacute; of Laplace and,\nlike his mentor, is\namong the greatest applied mathematicians ever.\nPoisson was an extremely prolific researcher and also an excellent\nteacher.\nIn addition to important advances in several areas of physics,\nPoisson made key contributions to Fourier analysis, definite\nintegrals, path integrals, statistics, partial differential equations,\ncalculus of variations and other fields of mathematics.\nDozens of discoveries are named after Poisson; for example\nthe Poisson summation formula which has applications in analysis,\nnumber theory, lattice theory, etc.\nHe was first to note the paradoxical properties of the Cauchy distribution.\nHe made improvements to Lagrange\'s equations of celestial\nmotions, which Lagrange himself found inspirational.\nAnother of Poisson\'s contributions to mathematical\nphysics was his conclusion that the wave theory of light\nimplies a bright &lt;i&gt;Arago spot&lt;/i&gt; at the center of certain shadows.\n(Poisson used this paradoxical result to argue that\nthe wave theory was false, but instead the Arago spot,\nhitherto hardly noticed, was observed experimentally.)\nPoisson once said &quot;Life is good for only two things,\ndiscovering mathematics and teaching mathematics.&quot;\n&lt;/blockquote&gt;\n\n&lt;center&gt;&lt;font size=+0&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#top&quot;&gt;Top&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/center&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;a NAME=&quot;Bolzano&quot; title=&quot;Ranked at &amp;nbsp; #151 (tie)&quot;&gt;&lt;font size=+1&gt;&lt;u&gt;\nBernard Placidus Johann Nepomuk&amp;nbsp; &lt;font color=&quot;#a00000&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;Bolzano&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/font&gt;\n(1781-1848) Bohemia&lt;/a&gt;\n&lt;blockquote&gt;Bolzano was an ordained Catholic priest, a religious philosopher,\nand focused his mathematical attention on fields like metalogic,\nwriting &quot;I prized only ... mathematics which was ... philosophy.&quot;\nStill he made several important mathematical discoveries ahead of his time.\nHis liberal religious philosophy upset the Imperial rulers; he\nwas charged with heresy, placed under house arrest, and his\nwritings censored.

Gauss\' masterwork became his life-long companion.\nFermat and Euler had proved the impossibility of\n&lt;b&gt;x&lt;sup&gt;k&lt;/sup&gt; + y&lt;sup&gt;k&lt;/sup&gt; = z&lt;sup&gt;k&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/b&gt;\nfor k = 4 and k = 3; Dirichlet became\nfamous by proving impossibility for k = 5 at the age of 20.\nLater he proved the case k = 14 and, later still, may have helped\nKummer extend Dirichlet\'s quadratic fields, leading to proofs of\nmore cases.\nMore important than his work with Fermat\'s Last Theorem\nwas his Unit Theorem, considered one of the most important\ntheorems of algebraic number theory.\nThe Unit Theorem is unusually difficult to prove;\nit is said that Dirichlet discovered the proof while listening to music\nin the Sistine Chapel.\nA key step in the proof uses &lt;i&gt;Dirichlet\'s Pigeonhole Principle&lt;/i&gt;,\na trivial idea but which Dirichlet applied with great ingenuity.\n\n&lt;p&gt;Dirichlet did seminal work in analysis and is\nconsidered the founder of analytic number theory.\nHe invented a method of L-series to prove the important\ntheorem (Gauss\' conjecture)\nthat any arithmetic series (without a common factor) has an\ninfinity of primes.\nIt was Dirichlet who proved the fundamental Theorem of Fourier\nseries: that periodic analytic functions\ncan always be represented as a simple\ntrigonometric series.\nAlthough he never proved it rigorously, he is especially noted\nfor the &lt;i&gt;Dirichlet\'s Principle&lt;/i&gt; which posits the existence\nof certain solutions in the calculus of variations,\nand which Riemann found to be particularly fruitful.\nOther fundamental results Dirichlet contributed to analysis and\nnumber theory include\na theorem about Diophantine approximations\nand his &lt;i&gt;Class Number Formula&lt;/i&gt;.\n&lt;/blockquote&gt;\n\n&lt;center&gt;&lt;font size=+0&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#top&quot;&gt;Top&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/center&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;a NAME=&quot;Hamilton&quot;

refraction mode; this was soon confirmed experimentally.\n\n&lt;p&gt;Hamilton\'s Principle of Least Action, and its associated equations\nand concept of configuration space, led to\na revolution in mathematical physics.\nSince Maupertuis had named this Principle a century\nearlier, it is possible to underestimate Hamilton\'s contribution.\nHowever Maupertuis, along with others credited with anticipating\nthe idea (Fermat, Leibniz, Euler and Lagrange) failed to\nstate the full Principle correctly.\nRather than minimizing action, physical systems sometimes achieve\na non-minimal but &lt;i&gt;stationary&lt;/i&gt; action in configuration space.\n(Poisson and d\' Alembert had noticed exceptions to Euler-Lagrange\nleast action, but failed to find Hamilton\'s solution.\nJacobi also deserves some credit for the Principle, but his\nwork came after reading Hamilton.)\nBecause of this Principle, as well as his wave-particle duality\n(which would be further developed by Planck\nand Einstein), Hamilton\ncan be considered a major early influence on quantum theory.\n\n&lt;p&gt;Hamilton also made revolutionary contributions\nto dynamics, differential equations, the theory of equations,\nnumerical analysis, fluctuating functions,\nand graph theory (he marketed a puzzle based on his &lt;i&gt;Hamiltonian paths&lt;/i&gt;).\nHe invented the ingenious hodograph.\nHe coined several mathematical terms including\n&lt;i&gt;vector&lt;/i&gt;, &lt;i&gt;scalar&lt;/i&gt;, &lt;i&gt;associative&lt;/i&gt;, and &lt;i&gt;tensor&lt;/i&gt;.\nIn addition to his brilliance and creativity, Hamilton was\nrenowned for thoroughness and produced voluminous writings\non several subjects.\n\n&lt;p&gt;Hamilton himself considered his greatest accomplishment\nto be the development of quaternions, a non-Abelian field to\nhandle 3-D rotations.\nWhile there is no 3-D analog to the\nGaussian complex-number plane\n(based on the equation &amp;nbsp; &lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;i&lt;/i&gt;&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; = -1&lt;/b&gt; &amp;nbsp;),\nquaternions derive from a 4-D analog based on\n&amp;nbsp; &lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;i&lt;/i&gt;&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; = &lt;i&gt;j&lt;/i&gt;&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;

he made\nrevolutionary contributions in many areas of pure mathematics,\nand also inspired the development of physics.\nHe had poor physical health and died at an early age, yet is still\nconsidered to be among the most productive mathematicians ever.\nHe made revolutionary advances in complex analysis, which he connected to\nboth topology and number theory.\nHe applied topology to analysis, and analysis to number theory,\nmaking revolutionary contributions to all three fields.\nHe introduced the Riemann integral which clarified analysis.\nHe developed the theory of &lt;i&gt;manifolds&lt;/i&gt;, a term which he invented.\nManifolds underpin topology.\nBy imposing metrics on manifolds Riemann invented\ndifferential geometry and took non-Euclidean geometry far\nbeyond his predecessors.\nRiemann\'s other masterpieces include tensor analysis,\nthe theory of functions, and a key relationship between\nsome differential equation solutions and hypergeometric series.\nHis generalized notions of distance and curvature\ndescribed new possibilities for the geometry of space itself.\nSeveral important theorems and concepts are named\nafter Riemann, e.g. the Riemann-Roch Theorem, a key connection\namong topology, complex analysis and algebraic geometry.\nHe proved Riemann\'s Rearrangement Theorem, a strong (and paradoxical)\nresult about conditionally convergent series.\nHe was also first to prove theorems named after others, e.g. Green\'s Theorem.\nHe was so prolific and original that some of his work\nwent unnoticed (for example, Weierstrass became famous for showing\na nowhere-differentiable continuous function;\nlater it was found that Riemann had casually mentioned one\nin a lecture years earlier).\nLike his mathematical peers (Gauss, Archimedes, Newton), Riemann\nwas intensely interested in physics.\nHis theory unifying electricity, magnetism and light was\nsupplanted by Maxwell\'s theory; however modern physics, beginning\nwith Einstein\'s relativity, relies on Riemann\'s\ncurvature tensor and other notions of the geometry of space.\n\n&lt;p&gt;Riemann\'s teacher was Carl Gauss, who helped steer the young\ngenius towards pure mathematics.  Gauss selected &quot;On the hypotheses\nthat Lie at the Foundations of Geometry&quot; as Riemann\'s first lecture;\nwith this famous lecture Riemann went far beyond Gauss\' initial effort\nin differential geometry, extended it to multiple dimensions, and\nintroduced the new and important theory of differential manifolds.\nFive years later, to celebrate his election to the Berlin Academy,\nRiemann presented a lecture &quot;On the Number of Prime Numbers Less\nThan a Given Quantity,&quot; for which &quot;Number&quot; he presented and\npartially proved an &lt;i&gt;exact&lt;/i&gt; formula, albeit weirdly complicated.\nNumerous papers have been written on the distribution of primes,\nbut Riemann\'s contribution is incomparable, despite that\nhis Berlin Academy lecture was his only paper ever on the topic,\nand number theory was far from his specialty.\nIn the lecture he posed the &lt;i&gt;Hypothesis of Riemann\'s zeta function&lt;/i&gt;,\nneeded for the missing step in his proof.\nThis Hypothesis is considered the most important and famous unsolved problem\nin mathematics.\n(Asked what he would first do, if he were magically awakened after\ncenturies, David Hilbert replied &quot;I would ask whether\nanyone had proved the Riemann Hypothesis.&quot;)\n&lt;b&gt;&amp;zeta;(.)&lt;/b&gt; was defined for convergent cases in Euler\'s mini-bio,\nwhich Riemann extended via analytic continuation for all cases.\nThe Riemann Hypothesis &quot;simply&quot; states that\nin all solutions of &lt;b&gt;&amp;zeta;(s = a+b&lt;i&gt;i&lt;/i&gt;) = 0&lt;/b&gt;,\neither &lt;b&gt;s&lt;/b&gt; has real part &lt;b&gt;a=1/2&lt;/b&gt;\nor imaginary part &lt;b&gt;b=0&lt;/b&gt;.\n\n&lt;p&gt;Despite his great creativity (Gauss praised\nRiemann\'s &quot;gloriously fertile originality;&quot; another biographer called\nhim &quot;one of the most profound and imaginative mathematicians of all time\n[and] a great philosopher&quot;),\nRiemann once said: &quot;If only I had the theorems!\nThen I should find the proofs easily enough.&quot;\n&lt;/blockquote&gt;\n\n&lt;center&gt;&lt;font size=+0&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#top&quot;&gt;Top&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/center&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;a NAME=&quot;Smith&quot;

squares?\nSmith made great progress on this problem, subsuming special \ncases which had earlier been famous theorems.\nAlthough most noted for number theory, he had great breadth.\nHe did prize-winning work in geometry, discovered the unique normal form\nfor matrices which now bears his name, anticipated specific fractals\nincluding the Cantor set, the Sierpinski gasket and the Koch snowflake,\nand wrote a paper demonstrating the limitations of Riemann integration.\n&lt;p&gt;Smith is sometimes called &quot;the mathematician the world forgot.&quot;\nHis paper on integration could have led directly\nto measure theory and Lebesgue integration, but was ignored for decades.\nThe fractals he discovered are named after people who rediscovered them.\nThe Smith-Minkowski-Siegel mass formula of lattice theory would be\ncalled just the Smith formula, but had to be rediscovered.\nAnd his solution to the Eisenstein five-squares problem, buried \nin his voluminous writings on number theory, was ignored:\nthis &quot;unsolved&quot;

developed\nthe important kinetic theory of gases; explored elasticity, viscosity,\nknot theory, topology, soap bubbles, and more.\nHe introduced the &quot;Maxwell\'s Demon&quot; as a thought experiment for thermodynamics;\nhis paper &quot;On Governors&quot; effectively founded the field of cybernetics;\nhe advanced the theory of color, and produced the first color photograph.\nOne Professor said of him, &quot;there is scarcely a single topic that\nhe touched upon, which he did not change almost beyond recognition.&quot;\nMaxwell was also a poet.\n&lt;p&gt;Maxwell did little of importance in pure mathematics, so\nhis great creativity in mathematical physics might not seem enough to\nqualify him for this list,\nalthough his contribution to the kinetic theory of gases\n(which even led to the first estimate of molecular sizes) would\nalready be enough to make him one of the greatest physicists.\nBut then, in 1864 James Clerk Maxwell stunned the world by\npublishing the equations of electricity and magnetism and\nshowing that light itself is linked to the electro-magnetic force.\nRichard Feynman considered this the most significant event of\nthe 19th century (though others might give higher billing to\nDarwin\'s theory of evolution).\nWhile Einstein, Newton, and Galileo may be the Top Three,\nMaxwell is a strong candidate for &quot;fourth greatest scientist ever.&quot;\nRecalling Newton\'s comment about &quot;standing on the shoulders&quot;

In his explorations of that problem he was led\nto questions of set enumeration, and his greatest invention: set theory.\nCantor created modern Set Theory almost single-handedly,\ndefining cardinal numbers, well-ordering, ordinal numbers,\nand discovering the Theory of Transfinite Numbers.\nHe defined equality between cardinal numbers based on the\nexistence of a bijection, and was the first to demonstrate that\nthe real numbers have a higher cardinal number than the\nintegers.\n(He also showed that the rationals have the same cardinality\nas the integers; and that the reals have the same cardinality\nas the points of N-space and as the power-set of the integers.)\nAlthough there are infinitely many distinct transfinite numbers,\nCantor conjectured that &lt;i&gt;C&lt;/i&gt;, the cardinality of\nthe reals, was the second smallest transfinite number.\nThis &lt;i&gt;Continuum Hypothesis&lt;/i&gt; was included in Hilbert\'s famous\nList of Problems, and was partly resolved many years later:\nCantor\'s Continuum Hypothesis is an &quot;Undecidable Statement&quot;\nof Set Theory.\n\n&lt;p&gt;Cantor\'s revolutionary set theory attracted vehement opposition\nfrom Poincar&amp;eacute;

he was a great &quot;universal&quot;\nmathematician; his discovery of gauge invariance and notion of Riemann\nsurfaces form the basis of modern physics; he was also\na creative thinker in philosophy.\nWeyl excelled at many fields of mathematics including integral equations,\nharmonic analysis, analytic number theory, Diophantine approximations,\naxiomatic theory, and mathematical philosophy;\nbut he is most respected for his revolutionary advances\nin geometric function theory (e.g., differentiable manifolds),\nthe theory of compact groups (incl. representation theory), and\ntheoretical physics (e.g., Weyl tensor, gauge field theory and invariance).\nHis theorems include key lemmas and foundational results in several fields;\nAtiyah commented that whenever\nhe explored a new topic he found that Weyl had preceded him.\nAlthough he was a master of algebra, he revealed his philosophic\npreference by\nwriting &quot;In these days the angel of topology and the devil of abstract\nalgebra fight for the soul of every individual discipline of mathematics.&quot;\nFor a while, Weyl was a disciple of Brouwer\'s Intuitionism and\nhelped advance that doctrine, but he eventually found it too restrictive.\nWeyl was also a very influential figure in all three major fields\nof 20th-century physics:\nrelativity, unified field theory and quantum mechanics.\nHe and Einstein were great admirers of each other.\nBecause of his contributions to Schr&amp;ouml;dinger, many think the latter\'s\nfamous result should be named the Schr&amp;ouml;dinger-Weyl Wave Equation.\n\n&lt;p&gt;Vladimir Vizgin wrote &quot;To this day, Weyl\'s [unified field]\ntheory astounds all in the depth of its ideas, its mathematical simplicity,\nand the elegance of its realization.&quot;\nThe Nobel prize-winner Julian Schwinger, himself considered an\ninscrutable genius, was so impressed by Weyl\'s book connecting\nquantum physics to group theory that he likened Weyl to a &quot;god&quot;\nbecause &quot;the ways of gods are mysterious, inscrutable, and\nbeyond the comprehension of ordinary mortals.&quot;\nWeyl once wrote: &quot;My work always tried to unite the Truth\nwith the Beautiful, but when I\nhad to choose one or the other, I usually chose the Beautiful.&quot;\n&lt;/blockquote&gt;\n\n&lt;center&gt;&lt;font size=+0&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#top&quot;&gt;Top&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/center&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;a NAME=&quot;Littlew&quot;

that exceed the Li(x)\nprediction, though few if any of those primes are actually known.)\nSome of his work was elementary, e.g. his elegant proof that a\ncube cannot be dissected into unequal cubes; but\nmost of his results were too specialized to state here, e.g.\nhis widely-applied\n&lt;i&gt;4/3 Inequality&lt;/i&gt; which guarantees that certain bimeasures are finite,\nand which inspired one of Grothendieck\'s most famous results.\nHardy once said that his friend was\n&quot;the man most likely to storm and smash a really deep and formidable problem;\nthere was no one else who could command such a combination of insight,\ntechnique and power.&quot;\nLittlewood\'s response was that it was possible to be &lt;i&gt;too&lt;/i&gt;

and much more.\nRamanujan might be almost unknown today, except that\nhis letter caught the eye of Godfrey Hardy, who saw\nremarkable, almost inexplicable formulae which\n&quot;must be true, because if they were not true, no one would\nhave had the imagination to invent them.&quot;\nRamanujan\'s specialties included infinite series,\nelliptic functions, continued fractions,\npartition enumeration, definite integrals, modular equations,\nthe divisor function,\ngamma functions, &quot;mock theta&quot; functions, hypergeometric series,\nand &quot;highly composite&quot; numbers.\nRamanujan\'s &quot;Master Theorem&quot; has wide application in analysis,\nand has been applied to the evaluation of Feynman diagrams.\nMuch of his best work was done in collaboration with Hardy, for example\na proof that almost all numbers &lt;i&gt;n&lt;/i&gt; have about &lt;i&gt;log log n&lt;/i&gt;\nprime factors (a result which developed into probabilistic number theory).\nMuch of his methodology, including unusual ideas about divergent series,\nwas his own invention.\n(As a young man he made the absurd claim that &lt;b&gt;1+2+3+4+... = -1/12&lt;/b&gt;.\nLater it was noticed that this claim translates to a true statement\nabout the Riemann zeta function, with which Ramanujan was unfamiliar.)\nRamanujan\'s innate ability for algebraic manipulations equaled or surpassed\nthat of Euler and Jacobi.\n\n&lt;p&gt;Ramanujan\'s most famous work was with the partition enumeration\nfunction &lt;i&gt;p()&lt;/i&gt;, Hardy guessing that some of these discoveries would have\nbeen delayed at least a century without Ramanujan.\nTogether, Hardy and Ramanujan developed an analytic approximation to\n&lt;i&gt;p()&lt;/i&gt;, although Hardy was initially awed by Ramanujan\'s intuitive\ncertainty about the existence of such a formula,\nand even the form it would have.\n(Rademacher and Selberg later discovered an exact\nexpression to replace the Hardy-Ramanujan approximation;\nwhen Ramanujan\'s notebooks were studied it\nwas found he had anticipated their technique, but had\ndeferred to his friend and mentor.)\n\n&lt;p&gt;In a letter from his deathbed, Ramanujan introduced his mysterious\n&quot;mock theta functions&quot;,\ngave examples, and developed their properties.\nMuch later these forms began to appear in disparate areas:\ncombinatorics, the proof of Fermat\'s Last Theorem, and even\nknot theory and the theory of black holes.\nIt was only recently, more than 80 years after Ramanujan\'s letter,\nthat his conjectures\nabout these functions were proven; solutions mathematicians had sought\nunsuccessfully were found among his examples.\nMathematicians are baffled that Ramanujan could make these\nconjectures, which they confirmed only with difficulty using methods\nnot available in Ramanujan\'s day.\n\n&lt;p&gt;Many of Ramanujan\'s results\nare so inspirational that there is a periodical dedicated to them.\nThe theories of strings and crystals have benefited from Ramanujan\'s work.\n(Today some professors achieve fame just by finding\na new proof for one of Ramanujan\'s many results.)\nUnlike Abel, who insisted on rigorous proofs, Ramanujan\noften omitted proofs.\n(Ramanujan may have had unrecorded proofs, poverty leading him to\nuse chalk and erasable slate rather than paper.)\nUnlike Abel, much of whose work depended on the complex\nnumbers, most of Ramanujan\'s work focused on real numbers.\nDespite these limitations, some consider Ramanujan to be the\ngreatest mathematical genius ever; but he ranks as low as #17\nsince many lesser mathematicians were much more influential.\n\n&lt;p&gt;Because of its fast convergence, an odd-looking formula of Ramanujan is\nsometimes used to calculate &lt;b&gt;&amp;pi;&lt;/b&gt;:\n&lt;br&gt;\n&amp;nbsp;

He partially resolved both Hilbert\'s 1st and 2nd Problems,\nthe latter with a proof so remarkable that it was connected to the\ndrawings of Escher and music of Bach in the title of a famous book.\nHe was a close friend of Albert Einstein, and was first to discover\n&quot;paradoxical&quot; solutions (e.g. time travel) to Einstein\'s equations.\nAbout his friend, Einstein later said that he had remained at\nPrinceton\'s Institute for Advanced Study merely\n&quot;to have the privilege of walking home with G&amp;ouml;del.&quot;\n(Like a few of the other greatest 20th-century\nmathematicians, G&amp;ouml;del was very eccentric.)\n\n&lt;p&gt;Two of the major questions confronting mathematics are:\n(1) are its axioms consistent (its theorems all being\ntrue statements)?,\nand (2) are its axioms complete (its true statements all being theorems)?\nG&amp;ouml;del turned his attention to these fundamental questions.\nHe proved that first-order logic was indeed &lt;i&gt;complete&lt;/i&gt;, but that\nthe more powerful axiom systems needed for arithmetic (constructible\nset theory) were necessarily &lt;i&gt;incomplete&lt;/i&gt;.\nHe also proved that the Axioms of Choice (AC) and the Generalized Continuum\nHypothesis (GCH) were &lt;i&gt;consistent&lt;/i&gt; with set theory, but that set\ntheory\'s own consistency could not be proven.\nHe may have established that the truths of AC and GCH were &lt;i&gt;independent&lt;/i&gt;\nof the usual set theory axioms, but the proof was left to Paul Cohen.\n\n&lt;p&gt;In G&amp;ouml;del\'s famous proof of Incompleteness,\nhe exhibits a true statement (&lt;b&gt;G&lt;/b&gt;) which\ncannot be proven, to wit\n&quot;&lt;i&gt;&lt;b&gt;G&lt;/b&gt; (this statement itself) cannot be proven.&lt;/i&gt;&quot;\nIf &lt;b&gt;G&lt;/b&gt; could be proven it would be a contradictory\ntrue statement, so consistency dictates that it indeed &lt;i&gt;cannot&lt;/i&gt;\nbe proven.  But that\'s what &lt;b&gt;G&lt;/b&gt; says, so &lt;b&gt;G&lt;/b&gt; is true!\nThis sounds like mere word play, but building from ordinary logic\nand arithmetic G&amp;ouml;del was able to construct statement &lt;b&gt;G&lt;/b&gt; rigorously.\n&lt;/blockquote&gt;\n\n&lt;center&gt;&lt;font size=+0&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#top&quot;&gt;Top&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/center&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;a NAME=&quot;Weil&quot; title=&quot;Ranked at &amp;nbsp; #60&quot;&gt;&lt;font size=+1&gt;&lt;u&gt;\nAndr&amp;eacute;&amp;nbsp; &lt;font color=&quot;#a00000&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;Weil&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/font&gt;\n(1906-1998) France, U.S.A.&lt;/a&gt;\n&lt;blockquote&gt;Weil made profound contributions to several areas of mathematics,\nespecially algebraic geometry, which he showed to have deep connections\nwith number theory.\nHis &lt;i&gt;Weil conjectures&lt;/i&gt; were very influential; these and other\nworks laid the groundwork for some of Grothendieck\'s work.\nWeil proved a special case of the Riemann Hypothesis; he contributed,\nat least indirectly, to the recent proof of Fermat\'s Last Theorem;\nhe also worked in group theory, general and algebraic topology,\ndifferential geometry, sheaf theory, representation theory, and\ntheta functions.\nHe invented several new concepts including vector bundles,\nand uniform space.\nHis work has found applications in particle physics and string theory.\nHe is considered to be one of the most influential of\nmodern mathematicians.\n\n&lt;p&gt;Weil\'s biography is interesting.

Not only does Witten apply mathematics to solve problems in\nphysics, but his broad knowledge of physics, especially quantum field\ntheory, string theory, supersymmetry, and quantum gravity,\nhas led him to novel connections and insights in abstract geometry and topology,\nas well as physics.\nHis skill with string theory led him to a novel theory of invariants and\nallowed him to improve results in knot theory;\nhis skill with supersymmetry led him to new results in differential geometry. \nHe has applied quantum field theory to higher-dimensional spaces and\nfound new insights there.\nHe has proven several important new theorems of mathematics and\ngeneral relativity but also has had unproven\ninsights which inspired proofs by others.\nHis discovery that the five competing models of string theory were all\ncongruent to a single \'M-theory\' (sometimes called a \'Theory of Everything\')\nrevolutionized string theory.\nSeveral theorems or concepts are named after Witten, including\nSeiberg-Witten theory, the Weinberg-Witten theorem, the Gromov-Witten invariant,\nthe Witten index, Witten conjecture, Witten-type Topological quantum field theory, etc.\n&lt;p&gt;Witten started his college career studying fields like history and linguistics.\nWhen he finally switched to math and physics he learned at breathtaking speed.\nHis fellows do not compare him to other living mathematical physicists; they\ncompare him to Einstein, Weyl, Newton and Ramanujan. \n&lt;/blockquote&gt;\n\n&lt;center&gt;&lt;font size=+0&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#top&quot;&gt;Top&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/center&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;a NAME=&quot;Tao&quot; title=&quot;Ranked at &amp;nbsp; #103&quot;&gt;&lt;font size=+0&gt;&lt;u&gt;\nTerence Chi-Shen&amp;nbsp;\n&lt;font color=&quot;#a00000&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;Tao&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/font&gt;\n(1975-) Australia, U.S.A.&lt;/a&gt;\n&lt;blockquote&gt;Tao was a phenomenal child prodigy who has become perhaps\nthe greatest living mathematician.

They are both prolific\nproblem solvers across many fields, though have founded no new fields.\nAs with Erd&amp;ouml;s, much of Tao\'s work has been done in collaboration:\nfor example with Van Vu he proved the circular law of random matrices;\nwith Ben Green he proved the Dirac-Motzkin conjecture and\nsolved the &quot;orchard-planting problem.&quot;\nEspecially famous is the Green-Tao Theorem that there are arbitrarily long\narithmetic series among the prime numbers (or indeed among any sufficiently\ndense subset of the primes).  This confirmed an old\nconjecture by Lagrange, and was especially remarkable because the\nproof fused methods from number theory, ergodic theory, harmonic analysis,\ndiscrete geometry, and combinatorics.\nTao is also involved in recent efforts to attack the\nfamous Twin Prime Conjecture.\n&lt;/blockquote&gt;\n\n&lt;hr&gt;\n&lt;center&gt;\n&lt;br&gt;Go to the &lt;a href=&quot;#top&quot;&gt;Top of this page&lt;/a&gt;.\n&lt;br&gt;Go to a &lt;a href=&quot;mmdiscus.htm&quot;&gt;discussion of this list&lt;/a&gt;.\n&lt;br&gt;Go back to &lt;a href=&quot;index.htm&quot;&gt;my home page&lt;/a&gt;.\n&lt;br&gt;Send me some &lt;a href=&quot;mailme.htm&quot;&gt;e-mail&lt;/a&gt;.\n&lt;br&gt;This page is copyrighted (&amp;copy;) by James Dow Allen, 1998-2018.\n&lt;/center&gt;\n\n&lt;hr&gt;\n&lt;/body&gt;\n&lt;/html&gt;\n'</p>
